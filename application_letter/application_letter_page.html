<p><strong>RE:</strong> 	Application for Promotion to Rank of Professor</p>

<p>I compose this letter today to officially apply for promotion to the rank of Full Professor at the University of St. Francis. I have been teaching full-time here at USF since 2012 and am quite happy and pleased to put forward a Portfolio that clearly and legibly shows my having met the prerequisites for Promotion itemized in Section 2.13 and 2.14 of the <em>USF Policy Manual</em>.  According to Section 2.14.2 item d. of this document, which concerns promotion to the rank of Professor, the eligibility requirements are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>A professor shall possess an appropriate earned terminal degree with ten years or more of full-time teaching experience at a four-year college, including four years of service as an associate professor. A professor shall demonstrate measurable contributions to the university, one's academic discipline and/or the community.</blockquote>

<p>I meet all of the above requirements and thus am fully eligible to apply for promotion to Full Professor. I hope that my Reflective Narrative and Portfolio as a whole both make a persuasive case for my promotion and that it will, ideally, be very clear that my time here since being promoted to the rank of Associate Professor does indeed "demonstrate measurable contributions to the university, one’s academic discipline and/or the community."</p>

<p>All of the materials, artifacts, and evidence required to make this argument are available from the following <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/full_professor_promotion_portfolio/full_professor_promotion_reflection.html" target="_blank">web page</a>, which contains my Reflective Narrative and much more. Simply for reference, my previous Portfolio for Tenure, composed back in 2018, can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k55zrJZOI65w0IAZs7UfqUcm_IR__e6W2O5oTAV715U/edit" target="_blank">here</a> and a version of my most recent Post-Tenure Review narrative (completed in the Spring of this year) is <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html" target="_blank">accessible</a> as well. It is my hope that everything one might want to see and have access to is available right from the main page containing the reflection, thus making it such that no readers/committee members "need to go hunting for things."</p>

<p>In closing, I would like to extend my great thanks to Dean McDermott, Provost Roth, and all of my wonderful colleagues both in the English Department and also across all branches of the University—especially my colleagues in the College of Education with whom I have had so many opportunities as of late to pursue deeply collaborative projects—projects and initiatives that have been very successful and generative, not solely for faculty members, but, especially, for students as well. We have all heard the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child—I think that sentiment is also quite accurately and fruitfully applied to teachers, too.</p>

<p>Cordially,</p>
