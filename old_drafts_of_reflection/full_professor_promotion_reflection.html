<p>The goal of this reflection here is to explicitly apply for promotion to Full Professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of St. Francis. I spent the years 2012 until 2018 on the tenure-track as an Assistant Professor; my bid for tenure was accepted in that same 2018 and I have thus held the position of Associate Professor since then; I also chaired the Department of English and Foreign Languages between 2018 and 2022—taking a short break in the Fall of 2022 and Spring of 2023, I stepped back into this role in May of this year. This past Spring semester, I underwent the "Post-Tenure Review" process and composed a quite lengthy treatment of my time since receiving tenure. (A .pdf copy of that document can be found here; Dean Elizabeth McDermott's letter/writeup of the committee's meeting for that review is available here.) According to Section 2.14.2 of the USF Policy Manual, item d., concerning promotion to the rank of Professor, notes the eligibility requirements as follows: "A professor shall possess an appropriate earned terminal degree with ten years or more of full-time teaching experience at a four-year college, including four years of service as an associate professor. A professor shall demonstrate measurable contributions to the university, one's academic discipline and/or the community."USF Policy Manual, available here. Given that I have been a full-time teacher here at USF since 2012, with more than four years of service as an Associate Professor, I am eligible to apply for promotion to Full Professor; all that leaves is an argument for why my time here does indeed "demonstrate measurable contributions to the university, one's academic discipline and/or the community." It is to this very task that I would like to turn now. </p>
<h2 id="0.1-initial-caveats">0.1 Initial Caveats</h2>
<p>Before jumping into my argument, I would like to put forward a caveat or two. Since I just underwent the "Post-Tenure" review process in the Spring of this year, a good deal of material and reflection on my part has already been completed. I composed a rather lengthy narrative concerning my time since being granted tenure in 2018. This (perhaps way too long) document can be accessed in an html version here. I will hopefully manage to attempt not to mechanically reproduce all of the work there; instead, I would like to take that product as a kind of starting point and grounding feature to then proffer something new here in this document. That said, I will no doubt have frequent recourse to this prior work—as I do think that it might possibly provide an even better treatment of certain components (my teaching, especially) of my time as an Associate Professor—and will signal that as clearly as possible when necessary. </p>
<h3 id="0.1.1-initial-caveats">
0.1.1 Revisiting My Tenure Portfolio's Future Goals and Plans
</h3>
<p>In my Post-Tenure Review work, I briefly had recourse to the goals and plans I set forward in my original portfolio for Tenure.See Section 4 of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, pp. 133-34. My portfolio for Tenure from 2018 can be accessedhere. I did not spend a great deal of time revisiting and rethinking those original plans in the Post-Tenure Review reflection, but I think it might be nice to start there in this request for promotion. </p>
<p>In my application for tenure, I proposed that my years after earning tenure should put a focus on scholarship slightly above my service responsibilities. That said, the majority of that section in my portfolio actually focused on a number of projects that fall under the rubric of service. Those four items were: </p>
<ol class="initial-section-numbered-list">
<li>
The creation of an Interdisciplinary Humanities Institute at USF.
</li>
<li>
A proposal for a potential "Great Books" program as a potential way to
re-envision the old "Core"/Gen Ed curricula.
</li>
<li>
Thinking about the potential creation of a BA degree in Philosophy.
</li>
<li>The creation of an MA degree in the Department of English.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I noted in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, none of these plans "really [came] to fruition." We do not have any kind of Humanities Institute here at USF (although, I wonder if some of the conversations Provost Roth and Dean McDermott about a plan to restructure the College of Arts and Sciences might benefit from re-raising this idea); many will say that Gen Ed and the "Foundations" programs are still in great need of rethinking and re(en)visioning, now that the group working on the "Pathways" program did not carry the day and receive funding from the NEH that they applied for; USF is also still a liberal arts institution without the possibility of earning a BA in Philosophy; USF also has very few MA programs in CAS and the English Department is still lacking an MA degree program. In the previously mentioned Post-Tenure Review Reflection, I did wonder if it was "all bad" to say that none of these aspirations actually panned out. I suppose that evaluation is in the eye of the beholder. I should highlight also that I did mention wanting to work on my scholarly record after tenure—and I am quite pleased to say that that goal strikes me as having been well-achieved.For more information on this, please see Section 2. of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection. However, in terms of these Service endeavors, things, clearly, did not quite work out the way I had hoped all those years ago. Of course, if I'm being as fair to myself as possible, one could make a case that item 4. is one that—although not fully completed—is one that is still alive and "on the table." Although we do not have a fully-fledged MA program for English, we do have an incredibly robust series of six graduate-level courses that are currently offered to working secondary education professionals in order to get them credentialed to teach "Dual-Credit" courses in English Composition in the high schools.For a little bit of information on this whole process, please see ibid., pages 131-32. The creation of these (now quite successful and incredibly well-received) courses was a substantial effort on the part of my colleagues and I in the English Department. We designed six brand-new courses to help meet a need in the surrounding high school community (all thanks to registering this need go to Dean John Gambro and Missie Rolinitis over in the College of Education and REAL Academy, respectively). The schedule now has us running two courses per semester (with one on the books for the summer semesters, at this point in time) and we have seen some rather nice enrollment numbers: This plot here shows all the combined numbers for each pair of courses offered each semester. A graph showing all of the enrollments by individual course number can be found here. Also, the Python script used to generate this plot is available at the following link. I myself have taught almost all of these courses—five of six, to be precise—and the affirmations from students that have been sent my way are nothing short of downright wonderful. I have selected out only a very select list from all these wonderful notes these students (teachers!) sent my way: </p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Over the past year or so we had an incredibly fantastic and stellar cohort of teachers from schools in the Glenbard area. They were with me for all five of those six courses I mentioned just before. I received such beautiful affirmations from them as they were incredibly profuse in their praise and appreciation of my pedagogy. In terms of more specifics, these teachers were very effusive regarding the kind of environment that I helped fashion for all of us to work within over the eight-weeks of each seminar. Anna Jakubka, a fantastic student and teacher noted how much she loved my use of feedback to student work: "... I really appreciate your constant feedback [sic] in this class; it's more than any other online course I've taken!"Anna Jakubka, personal correspondence, July 27, 2022. I would love to dive right straight into the pedagogical theorizations that make it so that comments like this are just "par for course" for me in my seminars, but, will leave that for the explicit "Teaching" section of this narrative. For the moment, all I really wanted to note here was that although a full MA program is still not in existence, at least half of the work towards such a goal is already complete and on the books, so it is definitely something that I and the English Department should kick the tires on here in the near future. </p>
<p>With regards to the other three items—the Humanities Institute, a reworking of the Gen Ed curriculum, and a Philosophy Major—the second one still seems doable. As many faculty know, the Provost has significant Gen Ed revision on her list of agenda items for the next couple of years. This is a matter and issue that I am no doubt given quite a lot of thought to over all of my years at USF. I will plan to return to this concern more fully and extensively in my Service section below. In terms of the Service goals I set forth in my Tenure Portfolio, clearly the majority have not come to fruition. That said, in that very same document, I did write that I hoped my next few years would demonstrate my increasing my scholarly endeavors and productivity—and that is a goal that I did manage to achieve. Writing of all these things in my Post-Tenure Review from this past Spring Semester, I admitted: </p>
<blockquote> Is it all bad to say [that none of these Service goals have really come to fruition]—i.e. that none of the plans mentioned in the final section of my portfolio have worked out? No, not at all—and the fact ... that I managed to beef-up my publication record is not to be given short-shrift. We all know—I think—how difficult it is for us here at USF to focus on our scholarly production (that's not anything that everybody doesn't already know)—the fact that I was able to pull such a thing off while running a wonderful English Department is not to be brushed off too easily either.Again, taken from my Post-Tenure Review. </blockquote>
<p>So, having canvassed some of the plans I laid out in my last major Portfolio, I would like to move along now to the three major pillars for Promotion, namely, the realms of Teaching, Scholarship, and Service. </p>
<h1 id="1-teaching">1. Teaching</h1>
<h2 id="1.1-some-general-background-remarks-on-teaching-in-general">
1.1 Some General Background Remarks on Teaching in General
</h2>
<p>In order to lay out the field here for my remarks about my Teaching since receiving Tenure, I would like to go back yet again to my Spring 2023 Post-Tenure Review narrative, where I wrote about "Looking Back at the Future Plans Set Forth in My Portfolio for Tenure (2018)": </p>
<blockquote>I should be brutally honest and confess here that my Tenure Portfolio is a document that I do not think I have ever looked at since being granted tenure. I have no doubt this is a terrifying thing to admit, but it's the truth. I would venture to guess that I can't be the only [one] for whom this is true—a tenure portfolio (if it is successful) might quite ideally be something we create and then get to say, "Goodness, I'm glad I don't have to look at [that] thing for one more second." Is this the best [way] to do things? Probably not—but I'd be shocked if all of us who have been through the tenure process would deny that we have at least thought something eerily similar to what I confess here. That said, I have no doubt that one of the things that the "Post-Tenure" review process might encourage (though I notice that this is not elucidated or enumerated anywhere in the Policy Manual) is our taking out that old thing, dusting it off a bit, taking a gander at it and then saying: "Sheesh, things definitely didn't turn out the way I anticipated they would ..." As I say, there are good and bad ways to spin this—and thus with my glaring confession out of the way, I would like to dust this thing off and see if there's anything in it that has stood the test of time.Ibid. </blockquote>
<p>I often think that when we look back on our work "when we were younger," it strikes me as somewhat healthy and preferable to take a gander back at the past and be slightly incredulous about the things that we wrote and thought at the time. If we do not quite do this, then it's possible that we haven't really changed all that much in the intervening years between then and now. I would thus like to begin thinking about what's different in my teaching now as opposed to all those years ago before being granted tenure; I am, by and large, quite surprised at some of the things that I wrote in that original 2018 Self-Assessment—not so much because my fundamental positions on things have radically or drastically changed. Indeed, looking back on that narrative, I am quite surprised and shocked by what I did not write or did not say. Of course, I think there are good reasons for this: at the time, I was not aware of how profound certain ways of thinking about my own pedagogy and philosophy of teaching would be somewhat significantly altered and intensified in many ways. It is hard—some will say it is impossible—to know in the moment what may eventually become a kind of "watershed" moment for us in our work, our lives, etc. Perhaps those watershed moments only begin to look like highly pivotal moments in retrospect; it would thus be a purely "retroactive" thing when we situation a moment, a time, an event within a larger narrative thread. At the time, it was perhaps hardly pivotal, but only becomes so when we retroactively select it out as significant or profound. Now, admittedly, all this is a bit abstract, so I would like to try to make it all a little bit more concrete now. </p>
<p>So what is it that I was surprised—rereading my Tenure Portfolio—that I did not say at the time? If I try to think about all of my years teaching—both Pre- and Post-Tenure—I think that although my techniques and strategies and methodologies have not drastically, I do like thing that what happened over time was that I "settled into" a number of really foundational positions and philosophical perspectives regarding teaching as a whole. If I try to date this in some more specific way, I can recall a day back in the Fall of 2016 when I was walking over to the library to teach the upper-division course on Shakespeare (ENGL 372). I can remember, just as if it was yesterday, thinking that I was not incredibly enthused about some of the "first-day" housekeeping activities that we as teachers are all-too-familiar with and that read to us as functioning as a kind of "boilerplate" for our time in the classroom. Now, please do not get me wrong, I was incredibly excited to teach an author and figure that has been incredibly important to me over my time as a teacher and scholar. That said, worries about something as simple as the reading list, were crammed into my head, full almost to the brim and ready to burst. I again, even today, recall thinking to myself, "I'm a bit tired of just unilaterally dictating the reading list to students; I don't think I want to do that anymore; perhaps there's another way we could do all of this." That day I had a kind of "bare bones" syllabus, of a sort, to pass out to students, but the actual plays and poems by Shakespeare we were going to read was a complete and total blank. That morning I gave students full-rein: they would decide what we read, how we engaged it, what we did with it—and I proposed very little, dictated nothing short of a suggestion or two about possible assignments and assessments that we might potentially consider. If I remember correctly, we had roughly fifteen or twenty students in that seminar—and by the end of the class period each one had selected out a poem or play they wanted us to all read together as a group. A few wanted to read some of Shakespeare's poetry—which is something that most students do not really know all that much about: they often quite surprised to learn that Shakespeare was known—before roughly 1598 or so—in his time as much more of a playwright than a dramatist (which is usually the way most of us today think of him); surprised to hear that most other writers at the time were perhaps much more taken by "Venus and Adonis," "A Lover's Complaint," or "The Phoenix and the Turtle," that Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, or Lear, many of them really loved their fellow students' choices to go into the "margins," so to speak, of Shakespeare's corpus. When students spoke or wrote about this course later on—as many did and that I reproduce in my original Tenure Portfolio—they focused quite strongly on the class discussions, the kind of environment I wanted us to grow and cultivate together, and much, much more. But, for myself, looking back, I remember how profoundly significant for me it was to take that very first day of class and fill not within myself and what I wanted and had planned, but instead, started with my students, began with what they were interested in learning more about, commenced the whole bizarre experience with them.This pedagogical principle became even more vivid, legible, and powerful, once I met my most favorite student I've ever had as a teacher, MaKenzie Hope Munson, in the Fall of 2020. The vast majority of my Post-Tenure Review is concerned with her and the educational trajectory that she and I built together singularly and uniquely for her. I greatly encourage readers to hop on over to that document for a much more extensive treatment of this pedagogy than I will provide here in this narrative. Again, did I know at the time that this very simple event—characterized by just a slight bit of distaste on my part for how a "first-day of class" is supposed to typically go—would become an absolutely foundational cornerstone of my teaching in the future? Absolutely not, but, looking back on it now, it strikes me as a truly pivotal and profound moment. But, in retrospect, it shocks me quite a bit to notice that I did not really talk at all about this day in my reflection on my teaching back in 2018. </p>
<h2 id="1.2-student-focused-pedagogy-and-gen-ed-teaching">
1.2 Student-Focused Pedagogy and Gen Ed-Level Teaching <br/> (ENGL200: Intro
to Weird Fiction)
</h2>
<p>It would not be totally accurate to say that my pedagogy became more "student-focused"; that would be correct to say, but it would not be the whole truth. There is little doubt that my Tenure narrative made very clear how student-focused my teaching always was—and the evidence for that was quite clear largely due to the fact that students were so adamant in their praise of this quality of my pedagogy. That said, I do find that this tendency to always be increasing the quantity of autonomy students had in my courses became more and more stronger each and every semester. A very nice place to see that is in all the work that I did to develop a brand-new ENGL 200: Introduction to Literature course focused on a genre of writing called "Weird Fiction."The Wikipedia entry on this genre is not bad and is sufficient for my purposes here. Prior to the first time I ran this course in the Fall of 2019, I had seemingly taught all kinds of different genres and types of literature in my ENGL 200 courses. I have taught sections devoted to Sci-Fi and Fantasy, straight-up courses focused on "classical/canonical" texts within the literary tradition, and even seminars zeroing-in solely on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien. Those courses were well-received and -liked by students, but I really hit on a winner when I switched over to doing this course on "Weird Fiction." Now, in order not to take all of the credit for how well this course has gone—and how much students seem to truly have adored it—I should say that there's little doubt its success has everything to do with the course content. Ever single semester I have students who introduce themselves in the first week of class as lovers of mystery novels, detective fiction, horror fiction, and, quite often, true dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi/fantasy fans (either in book or TV/movie form); this genre of "weird fiction" was absolutely made for students like them and they know it quite directly and strongly. In and of itself, this is not surprising—weird fiction does often borrow from these other genres, often quite directly, intentionally, purposefully, and powerfully. I think what was much more curious to me was how students who either weren't huge readers (high school English classes seemed to have managed to ruin literary things for them ten times out of ten) or who were big readers in the past and weren't anymore or who just happened to like genres other than those of sci-fi, the detective novel, or whatever else they had been exposed to earlier in their reading lives ended up absolutely loving all the strange, bizarre, and, yes, downright "weird" stories they found in the Jeff and Ann VanderMeer's edited collection, The Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark StoriesThe Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark Stories, edited by Jeff and Ann VanderMeer (New York: Tom Doherty Associates Book, 2011). Time after time after time, in their reflections on the course, students would highlight how enjoyable it was to read these stories—and also read things in a literature course that were so far from boring and unengaging as to not even be funny. When one hits on content that pulls in sometimes resistant and recalcitrant readers, one knows they need to dig in and think much more deeply about such an occurrence. </p>
<p>Now, it's certainly a legitimate question here to ask if the success of a course like this is due solely to the course content. I would not want to deny that such an thing was a strong contributing factor to why students have—almost without fail—truly loved this class. However, I do not think that this needs to be the final word on things—and I would like to say that this focus on student autonomy I mentioned in the previous paragraphs was indeed fully on display here in this context; this was also students were quite happy to tell me they also greatly liked about the course design as a whole. I should say, for starters, that if one looked with a fine-toothed comb at, say, the very first version of the syllabus for this course that I fashioned back in Fall of 2019 and compared it to the most recent one done in Spring of 2023, there would be far more similarities than differences one would notice. Still, the fact that the overall structure of the course has undergone somewhat little revision has everything to do with the fact that this first version was met with a great deal of positive reaction from students. Numerous students noted—this might seem such a banal and perhaps even all-too-simple, tiny little thing—that they loved a course where each week was laid out all on a single page. No modules to move through, no weeks wondering what might be on the agenda, no hunting endlessly for links to assignments, rubrics, and so forth.A .pdf copy of that front page is accessible here. Again, I was somewhat surprised to hear how something as simple as a "all in one place" main Canvas page could be for students (although, to be perfectly candid, this is something I 100% understand, but I am not certain that I knew how rhetorically powerful it could be for students and from a larger "user design" perspective). I should also say that I have been told by students that they have found the course to be very well organized and easy to navigate. Almost to the very last student, everyone found the navigation of the course shell to be quite simple, fluid, and often quite effortless. </p>
<p>Still, these two factors—course content and Canvas shell design—are significant factors, but, again, still not the real kicker for me when I think about why this course seems to have, from the very beginning, been run in an incredibly successful way for students. The real characteristic, for me, is this issue of student autonomy, which managed to drill all the way down to even the kinds of assignments and assessments the course asked students to complete and perform. Given that this is a Gen Ed course with students who were certainly not at the same level as the students taking that Shakespeare course I mentioned earlier, it made sense to give students a good deal of autonomy, but perhaps not as much as was given to English majors in an upper-division course. Charting a kind of middle path, I decided to lay out each weeks' worth of reading, but not to necessarily explicitly assign which students would have to read for any given individual week. Each week of the course had a number of stories from the anthology they were tasked with reading—usually between ten and twelve stories, parcelled out such that we could actually manage to potentially work our way through the entire anthology, which is admittedly big and thick and long. But if there were ten or twelve options each week, I gave no explicit/assigned readings. Students were given the freedom and liberty to speak about whichever stories for that week caught their eye. The only explicit requirement was that they pick three stories to highlight and discuss—while also replying to at least one of their fellow students' posts for that week. Writing about this in my Post-Tenure review, I noticed and noted a rather intriguing little phenomenon not so much about the number of stories discussed each week, but about the length of their posts (which, again, I did not explicitly specify: students had no word count and were encouraged to follow their gut and write as little or as much as they liked for any story in any given week): </p>
<blockquote> They choose which ones and then are asked to compose write-ups and analyses of their three picks, along with a response to a fellow student's post. (As is par for the course here, student autonomy and freedom is the absolute name of the game). I put no limits on student posts in terms of word counts. I have been really pleasantly surprised to notice that when I do not explicitly give students limits, they have something of a tendency to write and write and write. (Of course, I haven't really tried the opposite setup—i.e. explicitly giving students a word count limit to hit, but, of course, I would imagine many other faculty do this kind of thing: do students in their courses often write more than is explicitly required of them? If they did, I think I would find that to be rather surprising.)Again, this comes from my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, Section 2.2, p. 100 of the .pdf version. I should perhaps also mention that I can pull some explicit numbers here. Given that I've taught this course for multiple semesters, over multiple years, how often do students talk about more than the required number of authors in their posts? A little bit of coding and I can say that this kind of thing is certainly not the most common of phenomena—out of 2,353 posts, 23.5% percent of them talked about more than the required three stories in their main posts; in posts where students were responding to other students, more than three authors mentioned only occurred in 4.74% of those replies. (The Python code used to generate those numbers is available here.) </blockquote>
<p>I found it really beneficial and fruitful to make this autonomy and liberty glaringly clear to students right at the very start of the semester. Thus, the very first week of the course—where we read some "theoretical" treatments of the weird fiction genre (Freud, psychoanalysis, Mark Fisher's book on The Weird the Eerie,New York: Repeater Books, 2017. some of the remarks of H. P. Lovecraft,Again, the Wikipedia entry on this foundational pioneer of the entire genre is not too shabby. etc.) in the hopes that it could provide us with some coordinates for reading the texts in the anthology—has a rather in-depth (and perhaps too long-winded) discussion board prompt: </p>
<div class="pdf-container">
<embed height="1000" src="supporting_materials/1_teaching/course_materials/weird_fiction/week_1_discussion_board_assignment.pdf#toolbar=0" type="application/pdf" width="800"/>
</div>
<p>This prompt is admittedly a bit on the long side, but it lays things out quite clearly: students get to pick their reading for that week—either the Freud, the Lovecraft, or the Fisher—and get to write about whatever jumped out at them from their chosen texts. Obviously, students go wherever the spirit takes them (many go to Freud either because they happen to be psychology students or because he is something of a "household name," in a certain and for certain people). Actually, one can be very precise about this: the majority of students over all the years since I started running this course have slid toward Lovecraft. Combining every single student post in the ten times I have run the course, we get the following explicit counts of the authors (this output was generated using an open-source "PostgreSQL" client known as "Postbird"):  </p>
<p>Freud comes in a nice second place here, which is quite nice given that his text is probably the most difficult of all the theoretical texts on offer for this week. But, clearly, students do not shy away from this difficulty, but have a tendency to just leap right in.The data the above screenshot shows was pulled down from a PostgresSQL (a relational database management system using the industry-standard Query Language [SQL]). I created this database to keep track not only of all of my students' discussion posts, but also to make it easier to visualize which authors were being mentioned. I plan to dig a little bit deeper into some of the nice ways one could use such a database to chart student assignment work and other data later in this reflection. (I talk quite a bit in my Post-Tenure Review about my adventure of learning how to code—for those interested they can leap over to Section 2.2.) Actually, I should say that we can visualize things even more clearly with all this student data and look at the breakdown of author mentions for all ten sections of the course:    </p>
<p>Having all of the data available in one single database is so profoundly helpful in generating this kind of data: being able to pull whatever data one might want all with a few lines of code is not to be underestimated. We could even have a look, for example, at the Fall 2022 semester and look at the mentions of the authors over time leading up to the due date for the "Week 1 Discussion Board" assignment:  If one wanted, we could not bother filtering the posts by the timestamp of each first week post and then look at the author mentions over the entirety of the semester. This would give one a sense of which authors were mentioned after the explicit reading of that author was assigned. In the following plot, one can see Lovecraft and other authors being mentioned long after the first week of the semester:  All the code utilized to generate these plots (using the really wonderful Python library called "plotly") can be found in the Jupyter notebook (this kind of file is the industry-standard for most folks working with Python in data analytics, data science, etc.) here. (Additionally, if one wanted to take a gander at some of these plots focusing just on Lovecraft in particular, please see here for a plot showing all mentions over the entire Fall 2022 semester and here for a zoomed-in plot focusing just on Week 1). </p>
<iframe height="1015" src="plots_in_html/all_theoretical_author_mentions_over_time.html" width="1300"></iframe>
<p>Being able to look at the information/data in this way, a couple of things immediately come to notice, even (and especially) to myself. For starters, the plots for the summer courses (2020 and 2021) look quite a bit off—this is due to the fact that they were eight-week courses and thus the normal sixteen-week reading schedules were greatly condensed, thus making it such that students had more options beyond the five authors mentioned in earlier plots. The second item to note is that I may need to rethink my claim that these could hopefully "provide us with some coordinates for reading the texts in the anthology" that we would analyze over the next fifteen weeks. If these theoretical texts did end up becoming somewhat "foundational" for the rest of the course, shouldn't one expect to see them being referred to often over the remainder of the class? Maybe, maybe not—it is possible that these texts did end up becoming "foundational" in some way, but that this "foundation" didn't become explicit in students' posts over the rest of the semester. Although it may be the case that students didn't often refer back to the these texts in their weekly discussion boards, many of them did leap back to these authors in their "Final Projects." Just looking very quickly at Final Projects that were "text-based"—i.e. in files uploaded to Canvas that had .docx, .txt, or .pdf file extensions—again, just a few lines of code can get us some raw counts (the script for this aspect is available here):  These counts do not include Projects that weren't of a largely "textual" nature (I will have much more to say about this in just a moment, in fact), but we can clearly see that these first-week authors did not just drop completely out of students' minds, far from it. </p>
<p>Wanting to forestall the possibility of readers losing the point/thread here, I just want to reiterate my overall claim here that the key takeaway point here is not to be lost: student freedom, autonomy, and choice are the name of the game here—a game that I have found students really and truly love and enjoy possessing. </p>
<p>Before I return to this issue of "Final Projects" more specifically, I want to engage a potential rejoinder: Is it a problem, one might wonder, that the learning community here might end up becoming somewhat fragmented simply because it is not the case that all of the students will have read the same stories and, thus, won't really be working from the exact same knowledge base? I do not quite think so. It's highly debateable, even in a "standard" classroom setting (whatever that might mean) all end up possessing this somewhat mythical, to my mind, "same knowledge base." We all know no two students come to us with pretty much "the same" anything—their lives, their past academic/educational experiences, are all radically unique and singular. Why would one assume that even if we teachers tried to shove the exact same "content" into their brains that they would end up all have the "same" knowledge base? We know this is probably a quite unlikely scenario. I find, looking back over student posts, that more often than not this fact that not everyone reads the exact same stories was quite frequently spoken to by students, especially in their responses to other students' posts. Time out of mind I read one student responding to another with something that started like this: "Hello, James, I didn't read this story you mention here, but it sounds like a truly great read. I will definitely have to go back and read it ..." More often than not, students would read others' posts to get a sense of the stories that they didn't read themselves, but would go on to then read them based on the analyses from other students. This definitely gives the learning environment/community a "crowd-sourcing" kind of feel, where students often gravitate to stories that their fellow students got really hooked on and excited about. For some reason that I just cannot quite explain, the fact that students could themselves form other communities around a specific text they chose was a really key point for them; admittedly, one might say that such a thing is not precluded at all by a standard reading list/schedule where everyone reads the exact same stories, but, again, this added element is one that was quite legible to students and was an aspect of the course that they themselves noticed quite often. </p>
<p>Is there any warrant to a worry that with so much freedom, there were negative ramifications to this student autonomy? Absolutely not. Giving students an increased freedom from and flexibility with course constraints and requirements paid off ten times out of ten. As already mentioned, students were given free reign to decide how they wanted to move through and engage with the course material and—this strikes me as quite significant—when during the week they completed the work. Each week the discussion board posts were due on Sunday night at 11:59. Utilizing the database of student information and data I referred to earlier, it is easy (as an example) to plot out when students got their assignment completed each week—and only a few lines of code make it so that we can visualize this information for all ten sections of this course I have taught (the Python code used to generate the following plot is available here): </p>
<img src="img/weird_fiction/student_posts_on_time.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>Giving students freedom clearly paid off greatly as the vast majority of students were on time with their assignments each week; not only that, the quality of their work was nothing short of absolutely wonderful. It seems hyperbolic to say this, but all students seem to love this course—and the work they produced was work that I myself loved just as much, to be sure. </p>

1.2.1 More about "Final Projects" in Weird Fiction
</h3>
<p>In my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, I spoke somewhat briefly about all of the different kinds of "Final Projects" students have produced in this course. In that document, I did not really focus so much on the various project types, but used it largely to put into practice a good deal of the digital humanities knowledge I have gained over the last couple of years. I talked about the code utilized to pull data from Instructure's API in order to produce visualizations of the counts and also the wide range of different project types. Updating those counts to include the Spring 2023 semester, I now have a plot that looks like this:Code for this plot is, again, available here. </p>
<img src="img/weird_fiction/weird_fiction_final_project_types_and_counts.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>This time around, I would like to not simply count the wide range of projects, but to showcase a few of them. As the previous graph makes clear, a great number of students take a perhaps somewhat "traditional" avenue of working up a kind final "reflection" on the course as a whole. Still, there are a fair number of students that decide to be a bit more adventurous—this adventurousness takes many forms: many try their hand at writing their own "weird fiction" stories or poems or short screenplays; others (mostly coming from our wonderful DARA program led by Jeff Jaskowiak and Alby Odum) produce their own "musical soundtracks" to accompany their favorite story; still others have dreamt up and completed projects I myself never would have ever even imagined. In addition to many of these creative projects, I also often have many students who come my way from the Art and Design program (run beautifully, as I'm sure we all know, by Paul Erschen and Chester Costello)—some are painters, others work in ceramics, and a few have worked in even more different kinds of media. The creativity of these students too has always struck me as absolutely wonderful. </p>

<p>The above gallery of work is just a small smattering of a great deal of really fantastically wonderful aesthetic work produced by my/our USF students (and it obviously does not include all of the work that has been done in other media: audio, podcasts, audio essays, creative poetry, compositions of their own "weird fiction" stories, and so much more). On a strictly philosophical level, I take as a guiding mantra that difference, multiplicity, heterogeneity, are all to be constantly not simply encouraged, but strongly, strongly affirmed at every possible moment.I speak about this quite a bit in the sections devoted to MaKenzie in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection. This especially goes for student work: the more bizarre, the more variegated, the more heterogeneous the final products are the better. Of course, what is even better than this is how much students have enjoyed doing this kind of work. I directly, intentionally, and actively encourage students to take the content and material in this Gen Ed course and spin it towards the arenas they feel most at home in: DARA students love making music, so they should follow that desire and get the content to articulate with their home areas of study, joy, and expertise.</p>
<p>In the previous sentence I chose the verb "articulate" very carefully and with great intentionality. I want this word "articulation" to do a exorbitant amount of pedagogical and philosophical work. All of us in higher education—as especially those of us who have engaged in any conversation about "assessment" in general—know how prevalent and widespread discourse about "alignment" is when it comes to what we do in our classrooms with students and how that all gets cashed out at the level of "learning outcomes." Even back in 2018 when I first ventured away from my standard modus operandi in the Shakespeare course I mentioned earlier, I had already started to become more and more allergic to this language of alignment. My experiences teaching and training and molding MaKenzie into an absolute intellectual force of nature just put the final nail in the coffin for my thinking about alignment: such a metaphor became incredibly bankrupt for me. I am not at all clear exactly what the "intended meaning" of the "alignment" metaphor is (I'm not sure what the metaphor's "tenor" is, as the literary critics say) and I am definitely not sure I know what most people take this tenor to be, but it became clear to me that if our goal as teachers is to get everyone "aligned," then I am really not sure why such a thing should be the ultimate goal nor why it should be accorded the privilege that it seems to have in so many different communities within the educational field. If the goal is to "get everyone in line," then there is a part of me (the snarky part, to be sure) that wants to be a little brutal and ask, "Is this a vision of education as some kind of gloried version of 'teaching as standing in line at the DMV?' " I'm sure we could all agree that such a cliched experience as having to go to the DMV is often one we wouldn't honestly wish on our most worst enemies. Is this the best way for us to thinking about teaching and learning—as some kind of "standing in line?" As I say, if it is, I'm not sure how excited I am to jump headfirst into that. What exactly do we do once we get in line ... well, we just stand there and how much fun is that? Does this rhetoric of "alignment" not have encrypted with it a potentially passive conception of both student and teacher? I think so—and with quite a high degree of certainty, I should confess. But if "alignment" is too passive, then what would be a better word, a better rhetoric, a better discourse? What we need is something far less passive and static, we need something that describes things and people that move: this idea of taking multiple things, ideas, concepts, students, teachers, etc. and getting them to articulate with one another would seem to be infinitely, infinitely, infinitely preferable. We want a vision of learning that would be one shared with the way folks in the sciences talk about how joints articulate with other components of the body. This articulation, obviously, is in the service of movement: articulations allow one not to simply end up standing still (how boring!), but to move.Of course, one might say that this word is also preferable over something like "alignment" because the noun form also might encapsulate the best sense of what "alignment" ought to mean. As the OED notes—in definition 2. of this word: "Of hearing, thought, intelligence, etc.: distinct, clear; indicating clear understanding"—to articulate something is perhaps to get "aligned" in some way that is consistent with this definition. So, by this argument, "articulation" would give us the best of what "alignment" has to offer and, I would suggest, much, much, much more.</p>
<p>I should say that I have a seemingly infinite quantity of more things I would like to say about my preference for "articulation" over "alignment," but, given that I have no doubt already spilled way too much ink on this elsewhere, I am going to try to be a bit less long-winded and a bit more parsimonious here in this context. I think that it is pretty unobjectionable to say that all the work with MaKenzie is incredibly indicative of this pedagogical focus on dynamism and movement in our learning and it is undoubtedly the best place to see it in action.In terms of a more general philosophical treatment of thinking itself as a kind of movement (done with MaKenzie), please see the remarks in Section 1.1.5 of my "Post-Tenure Review Reflection</p></div></body></html> The goal with her (and with William as well<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-20"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-20" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote" id="20">I have not yet mentioned here in this reflection all of the wondeful work I have done with William D. Mastin, but all of Section 1.2 <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#mathematics-literature-and-philosophy-with-william-d.-mastin-23" target="_blank"></a> of my "Post-Tenure Review Reflection</span> is devoted to him and his educational growth and trajectory with me.) was never, ever to get her aligned ... frankly, with anything: the goal certainly wasn't to get "aligned" with me and my positions; the goal was never to get "in line with me" and what I thought about the texts we were reading, thinking, talking, and writing about. As I wrote in my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#further-theorizing-the-oedipal-detective-game">"Post-Tenure Review Reflection"</a>:
<blockquote>I have never thought that part of my job of training MaKenzie was to get her to just—either too simply or too dogmatically—take up my positions wholesale. She never took up positions or sides of an argument simply because they were mine—and although we are very close in so many ways, she was never one to show any interest whatsoever in simply mechanically imitating me and my own philosophical/theoretical loyalties. I have always put her own intellectual autonomy first ...</blockquote>
<p>Instead, we spent her entire academic career thinking together, which meant we spent all of our time getting our thoughts to constantly articulate with one another.In my Spring 2023 Post-Tenure Review Reflection and also in the document</p> I composed chronicling all of the wonderful work I did with MaKenzie ("Reflections on MaKenzie Munson and Dr. Spicer's Co-Authored Essay on Lydia Millet's <em>A Children's Bible</em>—Supporting Materials for MaKenzie's Senior Thesis Capstone Requirement for the English Degree"), I spoke a great deal about the learning that happens <em>in the space between</em> teacher and student—as I theorized it there, what I constantly referred to as "the space of the between" is the space in which this thing called "articulation" happens and works itself out in the pedagogical context. But, thinking here about the ground I've already covered here in this Reflection, it's clear that all I have said about the kinds of student projects that my "Weird Fiction" students have produced are also fantastically beautiful and wonderful examples and artifacts of this "articulation" philosophy in practice. Semester after semester after semester students have taken "my" course content and <em>articulated it with</em> their home areas of study. They took the freedom, liberty, and autonomy opened up my own explicit course design principles to make what they had learned in my course <em>move with</em> their own individual areas of passion, expertise, and skill. It also does not slip my notice that this very fact might be a significant way to show that the kind of pedagogy and mentorship I talk about so, so, so much (perhaps way too much) in my "Post-Tenure Review Reflection" about my two most favorite students (MaKenzie and William) is not just a one-off (or "two-off," in this case), but is, in fact, a kind of pedagogical philosophy that I have been able to enact and embody in my teaching of many, many, many students over the years, especially since receiving tenure when this philosophical/pedagogical position become much clearer to me.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-22"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-22" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote" id="22">Awareness of this concern strikes me as fully on display right at the start of Section 1.3 of my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#concluding-remarks-on-teaching-as-a-whole" target="_blank">"Post-Tenure Review Reflection"</a>.</span> This pedagogy cannot be said to be reserved only for the select few (or select "two," in MaKenzie and William's cases)—it is an embodied and enacted philosophy that is extended to all. Admittedly, I spent <em>so much time</em> teaching, training, mentoring MaKenzie and William to not just acquire knowledge, but to get that knowledge to articulate with everything else they were thinking about; I taught, trained, and mentored them so that their thinking could <em>move</em>. I think a similar thing can be said for my "Gen Ed" students in "Weird Fiction." Moreover, in all cases, what these students did was simple enough to describe: their thought, their learning, their <em>creativity</em> ... <em>moved</em>; it has truly been a sight to see for me, that's for sure. Of course, I can imagine another similar rejoinder that I mentioned earlier with regards to all the flexibility and freedom granted to students in how they moved through the course material: "But don't we need alignment—'standards'—that are universally applicable to all?" Again, my response would be similar: difference, heterogeneity, multiplicity are the goal here, not conformity and not standardization and alignment. Is it really a problem if the way one student moves, the way one students gets things to articulate with other things, is different from another student? Not for me—and I'm not sure why this would be a problem at all in the first place, if I'm being perfectly candid. I think the other big "buzzword" in our field that might be fruitfully invoked here is that of the Holy Grail called "differentiated learning," a perspective that can be defined as "the change of pace, level or type of teaching provided in response to the needs, learning styles or interests of individual students."<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-23"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-23" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote" id="23">See Eurydice-Maria Kanellopoulou and Maria Darra, <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1341326.pdf" target="_blank">"Pedagogical Differentiation in Primary Education: Conceptual Determinants and Definitions,"</a> <em>International Education Studies</em> Vol. 15, No. 2 (2022): 138-148; p. 138, where they cite this definition first given by Diane Heacox, <em>Differentiating Instruction in the Regular Classroom: How to Reach and Teach All Learners</em>, (Minneapolis, MN: Free spirit Publishing, 2014), p. 5.
</span> I have always been slightly confused by how precisely one might get this goal of "differentiated learning" to work with pedagogy that leans too strongly on this rhetoric of alignment. They strike me as very difficult to get to work in any logically consistent way together. If "outcomes language" is meant to be standardized/universalized, then how exactly does that work with this ideal of constant differentiation? If we are to treat every student as what they are—infinitely and absolutely unique and singular—then the language of strict outcomes might need to be either reworked immensely or (even better, in my opinion) jettisoned entirely.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-24"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-24" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote" id="24">Again, I do not want to unnecessarily belabor the point, but my position here is still identical with the one given in my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#early-days" target="_blank">"Post-Tenure Review Reflection"</a> (Section 1.2.1) when I spoke of my teaching of William: "This wanting to treat each and every student according to their own singular uniqueness was not lost on William—no two students are the same and our relations to them, therefore, cannot be identical either."</span> I have preferred to largely just jettison this "alignment" language—and I am quite confident that the results have been quite encouraging.
<h2 id="1.3-courses-for-english-majors">1.3 Teaching Upper-Division Courses for English Majors</h2>
<p>This philosophy of differentiation is also fully on display as well in my courses for English majors. As folks outside of the Department (and College of Education, too, I would say) may not know, a great many of our English majors are Secondary Education majors as well. We in the Department thus teach and train sizeable numbers of our majors to pursue careers in high school. This is a quite unique kind of audience—quite different from our "straight-up" English and Writing concentration students. In their cases, this issue of "differentiation" means giving students all kinds of opportunities to get their coursework to articulate with some of their larger career goals and trajectories. In all of my courses, I give future teachers (although this is not unique to them, obviously—all students are invited and encouraged to do this "articulation work") free reign in the kinds of assessment that they would like to propose for their work in the courses. It is often the case that students quite enjoy producing work for my courses that they hope will eventually become useful to them when they step into their own classrooms. A really nice course to use in demonstration of this pedagogy put into practice is our ENGL291 course on Adolescent Literature, which is obviously a really key course for majors that are planning to ultimately teach adolescents. Many students have decided to draw up extensive lesson plans illustrating not only their mastery of course content for the class, but also help out with their own implementation of this acquired knowledge in their own classrooms. A couple examples here can be easily adduced: see Rachel Webber's ('22) Lesson Plan Final Project for Lois Lowry's The Giver (Spring 2020) is here and Samantha Kohrt's ('22) Lesson Plan/Reading Unit Final Project can be perused here. In addition to such quite "practical-minded" projects, I have also had teachers compose standard "academic essays," with a great many of them focusing on the issue of book censorship, which probably won't surprise any of my readers. Texts for high schoolers and young people in general are so often lightning rods for questions about what material is and is not appropriate for them. This student work has also been quite stellar. Additionally, a good handful of students have worked on projects that would be helpful to them in their futures that do not officially end-up looking like lesson plans. A nice multimodalWikipedia's entry on this is probably good enough here. example of this comes from Hannah Bolden ('23) where she created a nice "Trifold Brochure" about many of the texts we read together as a group in Spring of 2020:</p>
<div class="pdf-container">

</div>
<p>Although this "YA Lit" course might be perfectly suited for secondary education majors, I obviously always have non-secondary ed majors taking the class. Those students also get full autonomy to design their own Final Projects and assessments. On this front, I might mention that the writing concentration students who are hopeful to carve out a life for themselves as (creative) writers have utilized this freedom to craft their very own "YA Lit" artifacts. Mary Kate Hynek's ('22) work comes most readily to mind here, as she composed a piece entitled "Katsaridaphobia," a long story that was written in a "YA Lit" vein:</p>

<figcaption>Screenshot of the first page of Mary Kate Hynek's "Katsaridaphobia"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There was even more creativity on display—although it's not exactly a "Final Project" or assignment/assessment—in my Spring 2020 session where students felt a very strong urge to talk about all of the texts they read in the semester by creating a kind of "awards ceremony" to rank the texts. I lobbied quite strongly and vociferously for students to choose any other title for the awards than the one they choose—but, ultimately, it came to no avail.A link to "The Spicy Awards" is here and a .pdf version can be viewed at this address. All seriousness aside, though, it was a cute little thing for students to do.</p>
<p>If one crunches some numbers with regards to how students are doing in my courses (measuring how well they're meeting our departmental outcomes), things look quite good and students are meeting these outcomes. Those outcomes are as follows:</p>
<img src="supporting_materials/3_service/english_department_materials/current_english_department_outcomes.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>Scores on these outcomesThe rubric utilized for our "Senior Capstones" for students in English Literature and Secondary Education can be found here; the rubric for the "Writing Portfolio" assignment required of all Writing concentration students is available here (The work that went into designing the rubric for the Writing Portfolio is due entirely to Dr. Anna Ioanes and Dean (then Dr.) Beth McDermott). for my courses look like this:</p>

<img src="img/ud_english_major_courses/scatterplot_english_majors_outcomes.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>These average scores are quite good (3s are for those "Exceeding Expectations") and I am exorbitantly proud of our English majors for these performances, to say the very least.The Jupyter notebook and code (utilizing this time around the "seaborn" graphing library within Python) used to create these plots, yet again, is here. I should also note here before drawing this section to a close that everything that I have talked about above is not just something that's solely "in my head." Students are incredibly well-aware of these kinds of things that are of a largely "philosophical"/"theoretical" nature for me as a teacher. Not only have students like MaKenzie and William written so extensively and beautifully of my teaching and mentoring and molding of them as intellectuals of quite stellar stature, but students whom I have not mentored and training as closely as those two mention how impactful not only my but my whole department's teaching has been for them. Sarah Deffenbaugh ('23) recently graduated this past May with her BA in Secondary Education (and is slated to begin and complete one more year to get her Masters this upcoming Fall) wrote in her "Exit Interview" about her time with us as an undergraduate.Sarah's full "Exit Interview" is available here. I would like to have readers just follow the link in the previous sidenote and read all of her responses in their entirety, but I will be satisfied with picking out just a few really germane moments and comments. For starters, the very first question is one that needs citing in full, without a doubt:</p>
<blockquote>As I think back on my classroom memories, the ones that stand out the most are obviously my English classes. From the first semester of college, I was absolutely terrified.  However, my English class helped ease my fears. I was in an upper level English class, "Playtime in London" with Professor Duys. The English students welcomed me into the tight-knit group and made me feel comfortable. Right away, I knew that this was a special major and a special group of people. I immediately fell in love with being an English student. Over the course of the years, I struggled with self-doubt when it came to my abilities as a writer and student, but Dr. Ioanes and Dr. Spicer both have reassured me and supported me.</blockquote>
<p>I cite this one in particular not because I am explicitly mentioned, but largely because my name shows up right alongside my colleagues, Drs. Duys and Ioanes.Full confession here, but I find that I also pull out this remark of Sarah's largely because I have (no doubt a perhaps some idiosyncratic thing about my personality) a seemingly constitutional inability to accept praise. And this is no doubt a problem given that my two most favorite students (Sarah can easily be included in this list of my "favorites," too, as can many, many more students I could mention) have written so much and sent way too much praise my way already (William does here in his cover letter for graduate school and MaKenzie does so here in her Senior Capstone Reflection, both of which I have spoken about unendingly in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection). I wrote there about how MaKenzie spent a good deal of our time together "tirelessly working to get me to accept" how impactful and life-changing our study was together. William has been attempting ever since we met to do something identical, as I mention also. I find, however, that what I wrote in sidenote 93 of that document still accompanies me even now. In terms of my focus here in this section, I would also like to highlight Sarah's response to the second question, which asks, "What kind of learning and thinker were you when you started out as a freshman at USF, and what kind of learner and thinker are you now?" Sarah writes:</p>
<blockquote>Freshman year, I was an—institutionalized thinker. I didn't stray far from what was conventional or what I believed people wanted to hear. Throughout college, I have shifted more and allowed myself to consider other possibilities and perspectives. I suppose the freedom of college helped that shift, but it was also my professors, who challenged me to think beyond what I was comfortable with. My English professors encouraged me to break out of my usual mindsets and paths of thought. For example, when writing my thesis, Dr. Spicer brushed away my cautious and expected answer to the question of how to prevent teacher burnout. He encouraged me to utter the ideas that seemed —taboo— to freshman me. The English department created an environment in which I felt safe enough to challenge my own ideas and break boundaries.</blockquote>
<p>I find Sarah's self-assessment to be absolutely spot-on. She can see the change in herself over time and I can immediately confirm without hesitation that this change was real. I (and I have no doubt my fellow English Department faculty colleagues) saw this change in her over time as well. It was an absolutely spectacular and wonderful thing to be able to see and witness, although I think she might give me a bit too much credit re "brushing away" some of her cautiousness in her Senior Thesis paper. I know we went back and forth—"wrangled" always with good humor—about the fundamental argument she wanted to put forward in that Thesis. It is clear to me that greatly benefited from those conversations—just as I did! The last question I would like to spotlight here is Question 5 of the Exit Interview, a question that concerns "professional preparation," which I myself have talked about quite a bit already: "To what extent do you think your education at USF is preparing you for a career? In what field(s)? More specifically, how well do you think your English courses have prepared you for work in the 'real world'?  How? Or why not?" Sarah's response, once again, strikes me as correct and one-hundred percent true and accurate:</p>
<blockquote>A refreshing change from high school, my English assessments and final projects emphasized autonomy, choice, and creativity. This is preparing me for my future career as a teacher. I have learned what is effective with assessment and what is not. For example, standardized tests are not an effective way to assess students in English. I really appreciated how my English professors focused on giving us a choice as to what we want to explore for our finals and creativity in the medium to do so. I will definitely be implementing that in my teaching career: allowing students to express what they know in a way that is comfortable and achievable for them to do so.</blockquote>
<p>Here we see the key thread that I have been trying to excavate from all of the seconds, minutes, and hours I have spent with my students both inside and outside the classroom. Freedom, autonomy, flexibility ... differentiated learning—these are the name of the game, pure and simple. I probably don't need to cite the following, but can't help myself; Sarah ultimately closes her Exit Interview thusly: "Thank you for everything. Dr. Spicer, Dr. Ioanes, Dr. McDermott, and Professor Duys: you will forever hold a special place in my heart. I love you all." What else is there that one might need to say after reading something like this? Sarah is going to be an absolutely fantastic teacher, I have no uncertainty about that whatsoever. Will this be due to the environment that the English Department faculty and fellow students helped to craft for her to live in during her undergraduate years? Sarah says, "Yes, absolutely!" and I am very inclined to agree with her totally.</p>
<h2 id="1.4-student-focused-pedagogy-and-graduate-level-teaching">1.4 Student-Focused Pedagogy and Graduate-Level Teaching</h2>
<p>In the interests of transitioning here slightly, I would like to start by noting that all this is not simply the case solely at the undergraduate level—its success spans all levels of my Undergraduate teaching, both at the Gen Ed and "English Major" levels—but it has also managed to move quite wonderfully to my graduate-level teaching, which I would like to dig a little bit deeper into here in this section. I mentioned earlier in Section 0.1.1 that since receiving Tenure my Department has developed a slate of six graduate-level courses for current secondary education teachers, designing them to provide candidates with the credentials required to teach Dual-Credit Composition courses in their home schools. As mentioned in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, this entire endeavor was truly a team effort on the part of Drs. Ioanes, McDermott, and myself. I will save a narrative about this larger project for the "Service" section of this reflection; now I would like to talk a bit more about how these courses have been implemented and taught, with special focus on how I tried to properly differentiate these courses for the audience in question, namely, students who are themselves full-time teachers with all kinds of other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the parameters for these courses—involving quite intense levels of reading in rhetorical and composition theory, all packed within eight-week modules—it was really significant that one struck a nice balance between the rigors of graduate-level learning and a high degree of faculty flexibility given that all of the students here were working full-time jobs. Thus, for starters, a clearly laid-out and well-designed reading schedule was needed:</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/enge_510_course_schedule.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>Along with a clear schedule, we leaned quite heavily on the format and course structure that REAL uses in all of their courses:Copious and infinite thanks go to Missie Rolinitis over in REAL, who was a constantly ally and supporter not only of me in all my course creation work here, but also for all my fellow faculty members. REAL already possessed a quite explicitly well-thought and structured course design workflow—we English folks needed to get into that structure and flow. I could never have asked for a better partner and there is little doubt that much of the success of these courses is due to Missie and her unflinching help and expertise in getting all of us English teachers feeling quite comfortable within the REAL structure and their perspective on curricular design. Missie and REAL more broadly gave us full academic autonomy (a thing not to be given short-shrift, for no doubt obvious reasons) and, again, as I say, I could not have asked for anything more.</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/enge_510_course_objectives_and_assignments.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>What is not quite explicitly shown in the image above is the nitty-gritty of the actual assignments for this first ENGE/ENGM course.</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/enge_510_week_1_db_prompt.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>The screenshot above shows the very first week's post for the ENGE/ENGM 510: Rhetorical Theory I: Classical Rhetoric course; as one can see, it is quite long-winded (as is usual for me, I suppose) for an initial post, but students not only enjoyed the depth and comprehensive prompt, they also enjoyed the freedom and flexibility present within it as well. Not every week's discussion board assignment looked quite this long and involved; students were fond of some week's where the prompt for the reading was something as simple as "Reader's Choice this week, everyone! Take us to wherever you'd like in the texts on the reading agenda." Designing good discussion board prompts for fully online/asynchronous courses are a necessary component of good courses, but it is far from sufficient. In addition to this, faculty feedback is also of the utmost importance. Looking back on student e-mails sent my way after completing these courses, I notice that student after student mentions how much they appreciated the feedback I gave them on their discussion board posts. Anna Jakubkha mentions this in her e-mail to me that I cited earlier in Section 0.1.1 supra: "... I really appreciate your constant feedback [sic] in this class; it's more than any other online course I've taken";Anna Jakubka, personal communication, July 27, 2022. Jamea Harper also highlights this facet very strongly:  I just want to take time to thank you for being an amazing educator. Asynchronous education has been an interesting change for me and I often felt disconnected from my instructors, except you. From the very first course with you, I felt seen, heard, and respected in a way that is unique for my graduate experiences (not just at St. Francis). Your feedback is so personal and thorough that it inspires me to keep pushing through difficult weeks and readings. ... . I am forever grateful for your approach to education, and aspire to be an educator like you. I wish your family health and happiness.Jamea Harper, personal communication, May 2, 2023.</p>
<p>Although it might not be necessary to do this—I am more than fine with just taking these student responses solely on their own—I would like to try to throw just a little bit of data behind these sentiments. If one looks at all the feedback I have given to students across the eight times I have taught one of these graduate-level courses since Spring of 2021, I have composed over 130,000 words across that entire span (the precise number is actually 132402).The Python script used to calculate this number can be found here. That's a long (perhaps too long) academic essay per eight-week course.I am hesitant to say how this might compare to others; I haven't the slightest idea if this is much more (or much less) that my peers. (I ponder a similar question to this in Section 2.2 of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, concerning the length of my students' discussion board posts each week, which, as noted already, do not have any word count limits set on them—I claimed there that students have a tendency to write quite long, nuanced, and extensive posts each and every week despite the fact that I put no limits or constraints on these in terms of post length.) My sense is that it's possible this might be on the high side of the mean, if only because it would explain why it is that students like Anna and Jamea mention it in their e-mails to me thanking me for my pedagogy. It is true that my fully online courses contain quite a lot of feedback in terms of my responses to what students write each and every week at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I should say that this is something that I can quantify and visualize. The following plot gives mean word counts of all my responses for each graduate-level course taught(along with the number of students in each section):</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/mean_word_counts_of_faculty_responses.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>The counts for the first couple of semesters are quite low compared to the rest not simply because of the low number of enrolled students, but also because most of my responses didn't go through the LMS system at all, but directly through the e-mail to students. It's also simple enough to produce a scatter plot that shows the actual counts per response rather than the average:The Python script used to create both of these plots can be viewed here.</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/word_count_scatter_plots_by_individual_assignment.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>I will spare my readers any long cavalcade of examples of my responses to students here and will simply rely on the quantitative data; however, I would like to give a little insight into not so much "what" goes into the responses, but more the "how," which was also greatly enhanced by my learning how to code a number of years ago and that I talk about a lot in the previously mentioned Section 2.2 of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection.</p>
<p>As those familiar with Canvas are perhaps all too familiar, the "Speedgrader" interface can become quite cumbersome when one has to go through and respond to, say, forty or more students each week—and this is precisely because each student gets its own page with it's own "Assignment Comments" box ... typing lengthy responses into this little box for a whole class of students is perhaps not inordinately, onerously cumbersome, but due to the way that the Canvas system is so heavily "compartmentalized" with its own modules, every student with their own comments, box, etc., can create a feeling of quite a bit of isolation and atomization. There are many more consequences and implications of this heavily compartmentalized structure and environment that does seem to make the curation of a fully-fledged "conversation" on a discussion board quite a bit more difficult than it perhaps needs to be if the design were slightly different and tweaked. Despite the fact that I am perhaps being slightly hypocritical here—I have not become so dissatisfied as to just chuck Canvas completely given the fact that such a thing is not exactly encouraged (and might even be explicitly prohibited by institutional parameters and constraints)—I think it goes without saying that the design of Canvas's discussion boards does not make it any easier on the user to curate and maintain a really interconnected discussion board that might mirror something like a "real conversation." I should confess that I'm hedging my language here quite a bit—other people, like Robby Burns for example, hardly feel a similar compunction, writing in his blog post, "Eliminating Canvas Stress by Writing Content in Markdown," that "Canvas is littered with user-hostile behaviors." Actually, this metaphor of "compartmentalization" I mentioned just now can be read in Burns's post as well. As examples of such "user-hostile behavior," we get the following: "Each class is a separate container. All files, pages, and assignments are quarantined, requiring multi-step procedures for sharing between coures. On top of this, the organzing tools are a mess. I am never 100 percent sure where to go. Even when I do, I have to wait for the internet to load each new thing I click on." Of course, these problems with the system being structured around this fundamental "quarantining" of containers also make the fashioning of good discussion boards quite difficult, to say the very least. Or, I should say that they make it quite difficult for me as the one who wants to "moderate" the boards by constantly linking/tying-up many of the student responses. The interface is not too horrible—trying to be as charitable as one can here—for the student. Each post on the board can be responded to in ways that we're all used to when thinking about "threaded discussions." But if a student, for example, wants to respond to one particular response while also linking it to another totally different student's post, such functionality is impossible to achieve in any explicit way. Of course, they can do this in the body of the post itself by mentioning another post's author, but this "thread" is not explicit—it exists only implicitly. One can imagine how much more frustrating this can become when I, say, want to respond to a particular post but link to three or four or even five other student posts. (The only way I can think of getting this explicit linking to work within the Canvas structure is to, perhaps, create separate discussion board posts for each story, but then that probably just exacerbates the problem as each discussion board assignment will need to reside in its "container," as Burns puts it.) Of course, there is a native way to do something close to what I might ideally want by using the little box directly underneath the discussion prompt that reads: "Search entries or author"; one can then search for the specific user's post that they would like to point explicitly and directly to.</p>
<img src="img/all_courses/canvas_discussion_board_screenshot.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>It used to be—at the moment in time when I compose this such a thing is no longer even possible—that you could get the direct "post id" of the post and this could be used in order to create a hyperlink that would go directly to that post (such might be a nice thing for those of us that rely so heavily on the discussion boards where any week's board might will have at least forty posts and replies and thus a way to not have to scroll endlessly when one wants to point at a post in a very direct way would be quite a welcome feature for this LMS), but, as I say, when one tries to grab the unique id of a post, the "entry" and it's accompanying id number show up in the address bar of the process, but then slowlyl disappears after a few seconds. I don't wish to belabor the point here, but this strikes me as perhaps another very nice case of a "user-hostile" behavior, especially, again, for those of us that really want to spend a great deal of time linking students' thoughts to other students' thoughts. It would be so wonderful if I could reply to Madeleine and then take a very short amount of time to get a direct hyperlink to not only John's post, but also with links to Emma's and Kristen's and ... so on. But, again, such a thing would be frighteningly cumbersome and would quickly become shockingly burdersome and ardurous. (I should also admit that it's possible I've just missed the LMS's possession of this functionality somewhere in the official documentation, but if so it must be in a rather "out of the way place" as I can't seem to lay my hands on it.) One should never underestimate the fact that these systems can have some significant consequences when it comes to how we interact with them—certain design structures do greatly influence how we move within these structures. When I first started out doing this Weird Fiction fully online, I posted my responses to every student post up on the discussion board itself so that they could be read by everyone. I did what I could trying to weave the student posts into larger clusters, but after a while I became frustrated and transitioned to just responding to students from within the "SpeedGrader," where the comments for each student went back to only that student. Now I do a little bit of a mixture—on weeks when I don't mind bending over backwards to do something that should be really simple, I weave threads together up on the main board; when I'm not in such a mood, I'll go through the SpeedGrader, although not in a totally direct way, I should say. I haven't noticed that students themselves notice any real difference that this might cause for them; I haven't had students wonder about why I choose one method over the other, but I am sympathetic to the possibility that students early in the experiment actually greatly loved being able to respond directly to my interventions for everyone else to see rather than through the SpeedGrader interface which, again, is a route that is visible only to me. But, again, I don't have good data on this either way—perhaps it's something to ask them about sometime in the future to see if it makes any real difference to them. I find that students love the feedback, they don't particularly seem to mind which route I take. In fact, in the graduate courses, I have always gone directly through the SpeedGrader and students like Anna and Jamea—when they talk about my "constant feedback" are talking about feedback sent only through the SpeedGrader. So all this might be a bit of a wash, so to speak. Just a moment ago I talked about my use of the SpeedGrader, but not in a "normal way"—I'd like to describe my workflow for this as it is a procedure that seems to manage to avoid some of the "user-hostile" behaviors that Burns and I have mentioned so far.</p>
<p>Burns's blog post was really a huge impetus for me to fashion the following workflow—his post speaks largely of authoring pages and other materials for his Canvas course in Markdown—a plain text format that is pretty industry-standard within the computer science/computer programming world. Most official documentation for anything software-related was properly written in Markdown at some point, largely because it is such a simple format that can be easily converted into pretty much any format one could possibly imagine.My initial forays into writing purely in Markdown down can be seen in one of my early blog posts, which focuses briefly on converting the .md format utilizing the pandoc library. I also have a "How-To" guide where I lay out the workflow that I used to take the original Markdown file of my Post-Tenure Reflection Review and get it into HTML and further stylized with CSS. When I came across his post, I was also getting just a tiny bit fed up with the LMS and thus starting looking for alternative ways of doing things. I thus hit on using Burns's idea of writing everything in Markdown or "plain text" (the work of Dennis Tenen on the benefits of writing in "plain text" was also heavily influential on my thinking hereFeel free to see Section 2.2 of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection for a little bit more on all of this too.) and then writing some scripts to bulk upload all of my responses to all the students posts for each week. So my process starts out with a very simple .json file that contains all of the student names, Canvas ID numbers, and then a spot for my comments (which get uploaded and posted in the "Assignment Comments" box in the SpeedGrader). Here is a tiny sample screenshot of what it typically looks like:</p>
<img ;="" src="img/grad_courses/student_feedback_json_sample.png" width="1300"/>
<p>The .json file contains fields for all the necessary data to be uploaded to Canvas: student_id, canvas_course_id number, a field for "text_comments_to_upload," a "score" field, etc. Thus, rather than composing responses to individual students all from within their atomized, individualized, "quarantined" containers, I compose all my responses in one single file. With all of the data "all in one place," one just needs to write a little bit of code to automate uploading all of this data directly to Instructure's API such that each student's data goes right into their "Assignment Comments" box in the SpeedGrader.For more information on this code, please feel free to hop over to my blog post, "Interacting with the Canvas Live API", which looks pretty similar to my currently-used incarnation (not much has changed since that post was written). Obviously, not having to type into each little "Assignment Comments" box twenty times (or—since I usually teach at least two ENGL200 sections per semester, sometimes three—forty or even sixty times) a week, it seems clear to me what a better workflow this is than doing all of this "manually." Of course, this still isn't terribly ideal: it makes it somewhat easier for me to not only weave together threads made from student posts, but it's also nice to have everything in one place simply for myself. I should say that I used to do this manually, I would often forget exactly what I said in response to Natalie's post (if it was one of the first I read); it's nice to be able to quickly just pull up what I wrote to Natalie and not have to click back in the Canvas LMS to find what I said ... and heaven forbid I possibly forget exactly which student I responded to about Aristotle's thorough distaste and hatred for the sophists; if I remember the idea, then a quick CTRL+F keystroke and I'm right exactly where I want to be. As I say, it's not a perfect solution, but it's not terrible. (As one last thing on my wish-list, I am radically unclear on why Canvas doesn't render HTML hyperlinks in the "Assignment Comments" box. Again, heaven forbid a student post something really fascinating about Cicero or Quintillian and I want to point them to a web page ... sigh: one has to post the full link, no hyperlinks/hypertext/HTML allowed. It's possible, of course, as I'm sure we all know, to use hyperlinks when one posts on a discussion board, but not in the Comments box of the SpeedGrader. Obviously, the same limitation goes for times when we would like to link a student to another part or "container" of our very own Canvas shells. This lack of functionality strikes me as exceedingly strange, bizarre even.) Robby Burns notes in his previously cited blog post that "we all go war with the LMS we have." I think that's incredibly aptly put. I find, however, after learning to code and work directly with the Canvas API that I "go to war" slightly less often than I need years ago. Don't get me wrong, I still feel like I go to war with this thing all the time, but, admittedly, a little less often than before.</p>
<p>Before drawing this section to a close, I would like once again take note of the fact that these graduate students had a similar tendency to my Weird Fiction students in terms of the lengths of their posts each week. Wrangling some data from the Canvas API, yet again, we can quickly get some data about the average length of their responses:</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/mean_student_posts_table.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>Some visualizations are also easy enough to produce:Once again, the script used to produce these plots is available here.</p>
<img src="img/grad_courses/box_plot_of_student_post_lengths.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<img src="img/grad_courses/stripplot_of_post_lengths.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<img ;="" src="img/grad_courses/plotly_stripplot_of_post_lengths.png" width="1300"/>
<p>It might be already quite clear, but the quantitative data here is hardly the end of the story; the quality of these students' work was nothing short of spectacular. Each week's discussion board was always incredibly well-composed with all of their responses, and their final projects at semester end was ten times out ten absolutely wonderful. Those final projects were often pitched and designed in quite multimodal ways—students completed Pecha Kuchas, fully digital "essays" on everything from Plato and Aristotle to rhetoric in general, along with a fair number of "straight-up" academic essays. As I say, ten times out of ten the work was incredibly exemplary. </p>
<h2 id="1.5-concluding-remarks-on-teaching-as-a-whole">1.5 Concluding Remarks on Teaching as a Whole</h2>
<p>In the meeting with faculty serving on my Post-Tenure Review this past spring,All thanks on this front go to Dr. Leia Levy, Dr. Lisa Hedrick, and Paul Erschen for agreeing to serve on my committee. Paul suggested that I spend a little bit of time talking about my teaching and work with students that were not MaKenzie or William. This was not posed as in any way critical; committee members said they greatly enjoyed hearing all of the stories from my time with those students. I have attempted here in this Reflection to try to speak to Paul's suggestion quite directly—although I do talk about William and MaKenzie here, I hope that I have provided a good deal of information and data that addresses my work with a far larger range of students that have crossed my path.</p>
<p>MORE STUFF SHOULD GO HERE BEFORE FINISHING UP THE "TEACHING" SECTION OF THIS THING!!!!!</p>
<h1 id="2-scholarship">2. Scholarship</h1>
<p>Given the fact that my Post-Tenure Review recently transpired back in the Spring semester of this year, I have a rather thorough treatment of the "Scholarship" component of in that document that strikes me as a wonderful accounting. I should also say that this is not even counting all of the digital pixels spilled on the collaborative work with MaKenzie that went into the composition of our soon-to-be-published (in October) co-authored article in The Routledge Handbook of Crime Fiction and Ecology—which is going to be the very first of its kind linking these two genres and arenas of academic study together. My write-up of all that went into this project is provided in incredibly extensive detail in Section 1.1.5 (and all its subsections) of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection—the full Table of Contents of that edited collection with MaKenzie and I right smack-dab in the very middle and heart of the book can be viewed here. Here in this section I would like to try not retravel and repeat that already-traversed space—although, I am (as many who know me here at USF are all too well-aware) so exorbitantly proud of my most stellar and most favorite student in all of my years of teaching for all of the work she and I did together on that essay (I'm far more proud of the work that she did than I am of my own contributions, though, again, I note that she will scrunch up her face at such a statement and I can hear her in my head immediately wanting to remind me for the zillionth time about "shortchanging" my impacts on her and her intellectual growth and production and work); I cannot even begin to say how proud of her I am as this essay slowly moves ever-closer to press and publication; words fail entirely to express my pride and joy in her work. Avoiding as much brute repetition as I can manage, I would like, instead, to talk about the latest artifact of my scholarly work, which is currently under review at The Hemingway Review—an essay titled "Jig on the Boder: The World and Time of the Simile" that was composed and co-written with my second most favorite student in my entire teaching career, William Douglas Mastin.William, of course, gets a large section of his own in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection as well, all of Section 1.2, in fact. Before continuing any further, though, I should note, as an update, that I composed this sentence on June 15th, 2023; the very next day I got word from the editor of the Review, Dr. Suzanne del Gizzo, that their "peer reviewers have enthusiastically recommended your essay for publication. In the words of one of the reviewers: 'Beautifully researched, considered, argued, and written. Brilliant work. Goes further than any work I've ever read toward illuminating how to read Hemingway. (Also: A perfect touch to end the essay with a question.)' "Suzanne del Gizzo, personal communication, June 16, 2023. Prior to receiving this good news, I was extremely proud of William for all the work he did on this project with me—work I am going to talk about a lot in this section, but I am, now, somehow, even more proud, which I could not even have imagined was possible given how proud of him I already was before receiving the e-mail from Suzanne. But how more proud could a teacher be of the student of his that gets his teacher to come to not only read and see things in a writer that he previously quite thoroughly disliked rather strongly, but to actually write and publish on that author as well?I speak quite strongly of my distaste for Hemingway in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection here. And I also notice in that very same section that I write something there that bears repeating: "I think we want our students to be able to change us—and to really change us such that they can honestly, sincerely, and genuinely can say of us, as MaKenzie did, that she taught her teacher, she taught her mentor something that he didn't know before. I would guess that William might be somewhat hesitant to agree that he managed to do this for me, but his reserved nature and quiet caution are completely and totally unwarranted here. MaKenzie drastically changed me; William did too. If our students can't do this to us, one wonders what it is we're all up to here in this whole pedagogical enterprise in the first place, at the end of the day."</p>
<p>In Section 1.2.6, I mentioned how William "and I [were] going to take a stab at writing together about Hemingway" and that as I composed that reflection we had "already started drafting" an essay on "Hills Like White Elephants."This story can be found in The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig—a Edition (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1987), pp. 211-214. Given the fact that so much of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection focused on the co-writing with MaKenzie—and because when I was writing that document William and I had only barely begun drafting the Hemingway paper—I want to talk about the entire process that went into writing this article.The original draft submitted for publication can be read in full here. I would like to try something similar here with the project that William and I completed (that said, I will attempt to be a little bit more parsimonious here in my write-up than I was with the work with MaKenzie). Due to the fact that so much of what I think—philosophically speaking—about collaborative writing with students comes from the Millet project with MaKenzie, I have no doubt that a good deal of how I think the endeavor with William went will ultimately be read only slightly in terms of the precedent set with MaKenzie. However, as a key caveat, I am going to very intentionally attempt to not play the "comparison" game too much between these two absolutely unique, singular, and "one-of-a-kind" students.Feel free to see, among far too many other spots to count, Section 1.2.1 for more on this. I have deep and profound pedagogical reasons—this might be all too obvious at this point in time—for not wanting to play the "comparison game," but the most practical reason might be simply because such a game won't manage to help me isolate from this whole process what is most important and significant to me. I have already written about my never wanting to treat and teach this pair of students in ways that would simply reduce them to being "the same" kind of thinker, writer, and student. What this means, first and foremost, is that I needed (and still need) to refrain from saying something like, "Well, the project with MaKenzie set itself up as the model that the work with William has to match up to ..." This strikes me as nowhere near the truth: one could not serve as a model for the other—and keeping this knowledge in the forefront of mind fell squarely on my shoulders given that I was the only shared factor: I was thus going to need to be very attentive to follow patterns that worked with MaKenzie—I had no guarantee that such patterns would transfer over between the two of them and thus I needed to do an entirely different dance when working with William from the dance MaKenzie and I did on the Millet paper. (I should also note that—in something of a contrast with the writeup I did with the MaKenzie project—I want to focus not so much on the Hemingway story itself, but more on the process that William and I found ourselves following, quite unconsciously, I would bet.) Right from the very start of this whole process, William—in his quintessentially beautiful "steel trap"-mind kind of way—was adamant about wanting to focus on what I can simply call the topo(logical)graphical elements of the story, which Hemingway paints in very sharp relief right from the very start of the story. I myself hardly paid these much attention, if I'm being completely honest; they registered in my readings, but were not really of any great privileged interest to me. William, however, was very interested in them and so we spent a good deal of time talking about them.Towards the latter half of our essay we spend a good deal of time on the all the temporal oddities within this story: the focus on time and temporality in the story is all due to William—I didn't really notice them at all on the first read through—the fact that so much of our essay focuses on the time of the story comes from him. It was William who constantly wouldn't let go of the way Hemingway "sets the stage" for his little story—with great emphasis put on the fact that all of the story takes place outside a train station that sits in between two rails in Spain. The story is rife with all kinds of pairs, binaries, in the landscape, in the built space of the railway system, in the number of characters, in the number of languages spoken in the story, and the list goes on and on and on—but it started to dawn on William pretty early on that what was really fascinating was all the story components that show an interest not so much in all of these pairs, but in the thing that draws a line, cuts a border, between two different things. I have spent my entire adult life (and even before that, I should probably say, in order to be as accurate as I can) imbibing many of the psychoanalytic insights of Jacques Lacan and writing/publishing about those discoveries. Lacan was very fond of talking about the "seminars" that he gave in Paris for almost thirty years as teaching his students (most of whom were practicing psychoanalysts themselves) that all he really did was teach them to count. In an essay from 1966 he said, "After fifteen years I have taught my pupils to count at most up to five which is difficult (four is easier) and they have understood that much."See his essay, "Of Structure as an Inmixing of an Otherness Prerequisite to Any Subject Whatever", in The Structuralist Controversy: The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man, ed. Richard Macksey and Eugenio Donato (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1970), 186-200; p. 190. Dates here might be worth noting: this citations comes from an address in 1966 at an incredibly infamous conference held at Johns Hopkins University; a few years earlier in Lacan's Seminar VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller, trans. Dennis Porter (New York: W. W. Norton, 1992), he seems to have been quite content to get his students to count to four: "I have already asked the question here as to what the critical conceivable minimum is for a signifying scale, if the register of the signifier is to begin to organize itself. There cannot be a two without a three, and that, I think, must certainly include a four, the quadripartite, the Geviert, to which Heidegger refers somewhere" (pp. 65-66). In this paper, William and I put forth an argument where we hoped to show why a proper reading of "Hills" cannot suffice with counting all the twos—one needs to be able to count to three, at least.This Lacanian concern with thirds, with cuts, with borders, with boundaries, runs all throughout the submitted draft for publication, but we (well, I should say "William" here) were onto this element very, very early on—it shows up explicitly in multiple spots in my own "initial foray" draft of the paper, which can be read here (page 11 is quite key on this front). I think there is very little doubt that all of the days, weeks, months, years even, spent with me in the office led William quite strongly to include and incorporate many of these Lacanian obsessions. William was really the first to zero-in on all the twos—and all it took was a tiny little nudge from me to get us focused not on the twos, but on all the threes that the story is quite clearly wanting to bring front and center.Undoubtedly this focus on thirds comes from my background in psychoanalysis—but it was also all of the work of teaching Lacan to MaKenzie that was a factor here too. See (once more) my "Reflection" on her/our Capstone project, footnote 22, in particular, on page 13. Despite some quite significant differences between the kinds of thinkers both William and MaKenzie are,See Section 1.2.1 yet again for what I still find to be the key intellectual differences between these two. there were some similarities that were already making themselves felt (as least as far as I was concerned). Very similarly to how it went with MaKenzie, William and I spent many, many days in the office in March reading this incredibly canonical Hemingway story. We read it together, we read it apart, we talked endlessly through what was going on in the story. Again, just like with MaKenzie on the Millet project, we talked a ton before we ever started thinking of putting anything down on paper.MaKenzie herself writes quite a lot about this "talking before writing" in her "Reflection on My Time as an Undergraduate at the University of St. Francis"—pages 6-8 are very germane. I also write endlessly about this in Section 1.1.5 of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, as I've probably mentioned way too many times already. As mentioned in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, our starting point was just one where we went through a profoundly close, careful, and minute reading of Hemingway's story. A great many details that made their way into the finished product were present quite early on—both of us latched onto the significance of the story's title, which contains a very clear simile. After we read through the story, William had—already—been making his way through, by now, almost close to one-hundred years' worth of criticism on this story, originally published in 1927. Day after day he would come with more and more secondary sources that failed to really even register the fact of the story's title as a simile. More often than not, these essays appeared, actually, in The Hemingway Review, itself—which I think got both of us thinking pretty early on, before we ever set pen to paper, that that very same journal might end-up being a very nice home for our work. William found multiple essays in The Review focused solely on this tiny little story—and our final essay is greatly indebted to a whole slew of essays published in that journal.Very key here are three incredibly well-known essays that both William and I read and respond to very carefully: Stanley Renner, "Moving to the Girl's Side of 'Hills Like White Elephants'," The Hemingway Review 15, no. 1 (1995): 27—41; David Wyche's very good "Letting the Air into a Relationship: Metaphorical Abortion in 'Hills Like White Elephants'," The Hemingway Review 22, no. 1 (2002): 56—71; Hilary K. Justice's really wonderful "Well, Well, Well: Cross-Gendered Autobiography and the Manuscript of 'Hills Like White Elephants'," The Hemingway Review 8, no. 1 (1998): 17—32. Far more other secondary essays find their way into our article's "Works Cited," to be sure, but these are the big ones. In addition to all this research from The Review, William also got lost in a number of (now rather) old articles from The Explicator where he, this time, found a number of scholars that mentioned some of the story elements, but did not fully theorize them to William's liking. When the anonymous reviewer says that they found the article "[b]eautifully researched ...," I can say with absolute certainty that I had absolutely nothing to do with that part of this thing. I think it's possible that out of all the secondary criticism mentioned in our essay, I was responsible for only one of them.I think it was the one by Claude Masisonnat, "Falling into the Embrace of the Muse: Pregnancy as Problematic Creation in 'Hills Like White Elephants'," Journal of the Short Story in English, no. 49 (2007): 57—66. This essay is available in full here. Yes, William would bring all of these essays to me each day (or, I should say, he pulled them from his library sources and tossed them into our shared "Hemingway Criticism" folder that I created in our shared Google Drive), take me through each and every one of them, pulling out their strongest points, zeroing-in with laser-like precision on their weakest components, and he would talk through them with me, always displaying his trademark incisiveness and uncanny ability to always put his spotlight on the parts of these essays that came up short for him.I cannot help but note that this is another frighteningly similar characteristic shared between my two star students: MaKenzie did something absolutely identical with Deleuze's "Crime Novels" essay (which served as a huge foundational pillar of her reading of Millet's novel), a short text by Jerome Jeffrey Cohen that she used brilliantly to work up her sections of our essay, and, lastly, a couple of texts by Timothy Morton that found there way directly into the final published version. Feel free to see page 7 of my "Reflection" on her Capstone project for more on this. After only a few days—less than a week, I'm sure—we had combed through so many secondary sources on "Hills" and absolutely none of them was hitting on the things that had been in the forefront of William's mind right from the very beginning. Rather quickly it started to dawn on me that we were perhaps already hitting something here that the existing scholarship had either missed or had noticed but not yet fully theorized. Having read the story closely, talking through our different perspectives/positions on it, then combing the secondary literature for readings that might have already beaten us to the punch and found none, the next step was to talk through how we wanted to supply the theoretical treatments of our interpretation of the story that would meet William's insanely high philosophical standards. We knew what we wanted to do, namely, we wanted to talk about all the binary terms in the story, while also paying careful attention to all the "thirds" in this short little piece as well; additionally, William wanted to get really clear on why so many past and prior readings of these story so often took up a perspective on the story that relied so heavily on metaphorical arguments. Why did so many writers claim "Hills" was some kind of metaphor: a metaphor about birth and abortion (which, admittedly, the story is about, to be sure), or some kind of allegory about Hemingway's own growth and "birth" as a literary writer/author, or as a figurative representation of things that happened in Hemingway's own biography? So many of the most often-cited essays, for William, fell into this trap. Why did so many read the story as metaphor—and how much of a problem for these readings is the very simple fact that the title of the story points us to the infamous (no, not metaphor, but) simile fashioned by one of the two main characters, Jig, in the story: the hills "look like white elephants," she says.Hemingway, "Hills," p. 211. Could we figure out some way to link all of these "twos" and "threes" to the question of the two major tropes at issue here: the metaphor and the simile? I had inklings that, as I mentioned a couple of paragraphs ago, that the psychoanalytic tradition might be of great help here.Once again, I note the cross-pollination here that was working in the (unconscious?) background of my thinking. On the days when MaKenzie and I weren't working together in the Fall of 2022, I would often talk to William about what she and I had been reading and talking about. MaKenzie got really hooked on certain Lacanian perspectives of what I wrote about in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection concerning certain "differences between 'masculine' and 'feminine' ways of relating to signifiers, to language" not only in Lacan but in numerous other French feminist thinkers. Although this discussion interested MaKenzie quite a lot more than William, the latter instantly saw the usefulness of these theorizations that we were working towards slowly. Rather than tossing William directly into the deep end of Lacan's incredibly significant texts concerning metaphor, we did some slightly more general reading on metaphor in general. I gave William countless canonical treatments of metaphor (in both the Continental and analytic traditions of 20th Century philosophy): Max Black, Donald Davidson, Graham Harman, Ortega y Gasset, Deleuze and Guattari, Nietzsche, Levinas, Blanchot, and many more whose names I cannot even recall now. In his oh-so-typical way, he consumed and devoured them voraciously. I am tempted here to say—again, just like I have with MaKenzie—that I was shocked by William's ability to consume massive quantities of reading in incredibly short spans of time. Both of them would read, work through, and extract all the key features of secondary source material that it would take other students weeks to churn through. They would complete tasks like this not in weeks, but in days. It is nothing short of absolutely mind-boggling. Even more surprisng—but perhaps not, since what had we been doing over the past two years learning to talk and think together but figure out how to do these kinds of things together withinin very tight time spans, pushing to incredibly deep insights that it would perhaps take other students far longer to come to in the first place?—was how quickly William and I managed to get synced-up on all these philosophical issues and concerns incredibly quickly. Looking back at some of my "Notes and Jottings,"For those that are curious, these notes can be read here. as I have called my scholarly thinking for the past twenty years, I notice that so many pieces of the puzzle we were interested in building came into focus rather rapidly. All that we really needed to do was, as already mentioned, figure out how we wanted to theorize all of the things that William noticed right from his very first reading of the story and how we wanted to theorize things quite directly through these larger concerns about out two fundamental figurative tropes. I myself knew that I wanted to handle this via Lacan and psychoanalysis; William wanted to tackle deeper questions about similes and metaphors through his great love and desire to think through such things in refreshingly wonderful recourse to philosophical and ontological treatments of these figures. Once we had a sense of what we wanted to say (I see in the record that on the 14th of March I added to my "Notes and Jottings" that "I said [to William] I would like to work through—with a little bit more converstion—about 'Hills Like' before starting to write ..."Ibid., p. 1.), we were getting closer and closer to being ready to get down to writing. Although I have mentioned frequently how I am unwilling to play the "comparison game" with MaKenzie and William, the latter felt no similar hesitation—we was quite curious to hear how the whole process writing with MaKenzie went and whether or not it might help him figure out how to write with me. We often spoke about what worked so well between MaKenzie and me and William often asked me to talk with him about the Millet paper. I was more than happy to do so, telling him often that I thought the co-writing with him would go similarly, but not identically to the way it did with MaKenzie. My sense, looking back now, is that this is a truthful representation of how things went. Looking back at my notes, I see that as soon as I had talked to William on the 14th of March that I still wanted "a little bit more conversation" about the story, that day was chock-full of a lot of thinking between the two of us. We agreed—again, differently with how it went with MaKenzie—that we would both start writing, but I started us off with something that MaKenzie and I only realized after she and I had begun writing. Those intense days in early-to-mid March made it very clear to me that William and I were (yet again) thinking together with one another, but I myself was quite anxious about how the writing would go—I haven't the slightest idea why and I'm not sure I could really explain such hesistancy if someone asked me to expand on it further. The whole writing process with MaKenzie was just so smooth, so smooth that she could say things to me like, when we looked back on the final concluding section of our Millet paper, that "she herself could not tell which of the two of us wrote it." As I've noted: "This was due, she correctly noticed, to the fact that we did in fact write it together. 'I saw things that I had said in our conversations showing up there. I wasn't really sure where exactly my thinking left off and yours began.' Indeed, I could hardly [sic] agree more."Taken from my "Reflection" on the Millet project, p. 9; there are paragraphs on p. 10 as well that may also be very a propos on this question about style in writing. I think I was pretty certain that, again, as already mentioned, things were perhaps not going to the same way for William and me. MaKenzie and I didn't quite exactly create our initial drafts in isolation; we both started writing our different sections, but we ended up essentially writing the same essay two times. This is undoubtedly due to the fact, as I've suggested elsewhere, that are minds are so similar, nearly identical. William is very similar to me in so many ways, but the way we think isn't identical in the way it is for MaKenzie and me. Or, what I should say is that MaKenzie not only thinks in a really frighteningly identical way to the way I do, but (and this still shocks me to no end today even as I compose these sentences) that she writes in a way that looks eerily close to my own idionsyncratic style. For that reason, I was just tiny bit worried about the writing part. That said, we both agreed to start writing, to get things down on paper, and then move on from there. William's initial drafts (three in total that can be viewed here, here, and here) saw him tackling the write-up in exactly the way I figured he would. Given his philosophical proclivities and preference for strongly ontological ways of thinking through texts, his very first draft, titled "The 'Is', the 'Like', and the 'And'—Hemingway's Hills Like White Elephants," began with his attempts to philosophically scaffold his intervention into Hemingway's story with an initial section title that says everything one might want to know about how William rolls: "Philosophical Lumber," he called it. It is actually quite a bit hard for me to describe William's style of writing. He writes, in many ways, as I imagine mathematicians write (which makes sense, he got his BA in Mathematics in December of last year). Very carefully, very cautiously (I've already noted elsewhere this personality quirk of William's his trademark "cautiousness" See here for just a tiny bit more on this "quiet" way William has of working and thinking.), slowly, with incredible precision and rigor. Just like I imagine a mathematician would (or should?), his style wants to get all the logs and two-by-fours in place before trying to build his larger structures. What is really fascinating to me—as I look back at this first initial draft—is that this pre-building, this scaffolding, work is so clearly on display in his first venture: aside from the title of the document and a mention of Hemingway's name in another spot or two, it would not be clear from an initial reading that talking about Hemingway's story at all was part of the plan. I say this not as a criticism (it's not—it's just the way William thinks and writes), but more to highly what is quite unique to William's whole raison d'etre. He wants things properly prepared before one gets into any of the nitty gritty. As I say, this is a wonderful thing about William and I greatly adore it and would never want anyone to take it in negative way. (The other reason I love it is precisely because it looks absolutely, positively, nothing like the way I write!) William clearly wanted to start his intervention here with an blindingly close and careful attention to how words like "is," "like," and "and" can work—as similes, as metaphors, tropes, figures, etc. Not only that, but he wanted these thoughts about literary language to be thoroughly grounded in all his philosophical reading—and such a desire is already quite apparent even in this first shot: Deleuze and Guattari show up, Ortega y Gasset and Levinas get shoutouts, and I can detect William's wrestling with Graham Harman's work here too.William spent a day or two wrangling with his chapter on metaphor in Guerilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things (Chicago: Open Court, 2005), pp. 101-124. Harman's take is definitely detectable in the atmosphere here in William's first draft. William's second draft shows thousands more words showing up, all of them focused quite explicitly and directly on the Hemingway story (which, again, is a major addition over the first stab, which hadn't quite found its way yet to the story under study). Here what is on display in full-color is William's finely-tuned attentiveness to the story itself. More and more elements of Hemingway's story get incorporated into this draft: his incredibly insights about the nature of borders, doors, curtains, etc. in the story is fully readable here now. The second attempt here also lays down some of the concerns about "waiting" at the station, about time and temporality, and much more—all of which William manages to link up perfectly with our now long-running concerns about doors, windows, curtains, borders, and boundaries. There are also clear hints of a lot of the work William had done with me in January and February on Freud's infamous essay, "The Uncanny."I speak a little bit about this here as well. All this discussion of certain "interiors and exteriors" in "Hills" has its origin in all the discussions we had about Freud. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention William's very quick (and yet still incredibly complete) reading of Nicholas Royle, The Uncanny (Manchester, UK: Manchester UP, 2003). The other thing that I'm incredibly happy and proud to see in this draft is William's mention of the concern about Jig's pregnancy in the story—and with the way that William was already trying to get the matter of pregnancy linked up so many other things: the simile as a trope, the importance of pregnancy's connection to time and temporality, the whole story as existing within what he calls the "world and time of the simile" (which, obviously, shows up in the paper's title) where the key element here is one of "waiting," and much, much, much more. (All of these elements were ones that I deeply loved when I read and made extensive notes on Will's drafts—there were so many fantastic insights here on William's part that I wanted to make sure I picked up on and incorporated into my own work.) So, so, so many brilliant insights—even in these first exploratory drafts, the lights of William's reading here were incredibly bright and luminescent. I was so excited to see where this was going to go. Transitioning now a little bit to what my side of the whole project looked like, I am so surprised, gazing back in retrospect, by how impactful William's constant poking and prodding to get me to return to Hemingway ultimately was at the end of the day. The person who just a couple of weeks before could not stomach reading Hemingway somehow forgot that sour taste in his mouth and started writing, a lot about "Hills Like White Elephants." After our initial conversations, I find that I wrote a lot about this story on my own as William and I worked on our drafts simultaneously and somewhat in parallel, although not really, if one's being as accurate as possible. What exactly am I willing to say that I brought to the table here for us in this shared endeavor? (Well, again, I don't really want to take much credit for any of it, frankly—I don't think there will ever come a day when I want to take any credit for it; it is so clear to me how much William was the absolute driving force for this whole thing.)  Drafts and timestamps:  Will's little "similes" list that followed along next to him through every step of the journey:  3. Service Transitioning to the category of Service I have engaged since receiving Tenure, I noted in the Service section of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection that a great deal of work on this front involved serving as Department Chair of English and Foreign Languages between the summer of 2018 up until the summer of 2022. It was at that point last year that I took a brief hiatus while Dr. Ioanes took the reins for a year.In that same document I thanked Dr. Ioanes profusely for agreeing to handle things for a year "as it gave me more time to work with MaKenzie and William and get both of them graduated on to the next set of challenges and adventures in their lives. All decisions come with advantages and disadvantages, pros and cons. This decision was full of nothing but pros, nothing but advantages. I will never, ever, never second-guess it." I still find this sentiment to be absolutely true and would once more like to thank Dr. Ioanes for serving as Chair between 2022 and 2023. The major highlights of my time as Chair are quite clearly laid out there in that section: the planning and implentation of the six graduate-level courses for teachers that I've already spoken about; the creation of a brand new major, Digital Humanities; a couple of grants that were funded to help us lay some nice groundwork for focus on "writing" across mutiple areas of the university; the supporting of Dr. (now Dean) Beth McDermott's bid for tenure, etc. At the moment in time when I was composing the Post-Tenure Review narrative, Dr. Ioanes had not yet discussed my taking the Chair position back at the end of the Spring semester. After a few discussions together, she and I decided that it would be best for all concerned if I make this last year a full "hiatus" year with me re-assuming the position at the end of May. There were undoubtedly many factors that went into our thought- and decision-making process. First and foremost in my mind was the fact that Dr. Ioanes will be submitting her application for Tenure this Fall—and it was this that suggested to me/us that things might be quite a bit smoother and simpler for her if I took back the responsibility of chairing the Department as she focused on completing said portifolio. As I mentioned in the Post-Tenure Review Committee meeting, I let those assembled know how happy I was as Department Chair to support Dean McDermott's tenure bid—I wanted to make clear that this happiness was shared 100% with Anna's upcoming bid. I will be so honored to help her out in any way I possibly can. She is an absolutely wonderful teacher, shoclar, and colleague. I have greatly enjoyed working with her since she came to us back in 2018, right as I was taking over the Chair position from Dr. Karen Duys that summer. I have tried to be an incredibly staunch ally and supporter of Anna, to say the very least, and will continue trying to do this each and every day going forward. Given that I have already canvased my Service work in the past, I think it might be helpful for me to try to talk a bit about what is on my/our radar as a Department and what future service might ultimately look like going forward.  4. Miscellaneous Materials 4.1 On the Matter of Student Evaluations Here are some plots of the evaluation data available through courseval.net for my teaching:  Admittedly, these scores are pretty good, but I would like to say that I want to be somewhat careful with this data, given that my student evaluations have pretty low response rates. Looking at the percentages of students completing the evaluations, we see the following:    semester crs_num year expected received pct     fall ENGL200 2021 19 6 32   fall ENGL200 2021 21 11 52   fall ENGL321 2021 15 8 53   fall ENGL200 2022 20 6 30   fall ENGL200 2022 19 3 16   fall ENGL200 2022 18 8 44   fall ENGL372 2022 12 3 25   spring ENGL200 2021 48 20 42   spring ENGL354 2021 13 6 46   spring ENGM510 2021 1 1 100   spring ENGL200 2022 17 5 29   spring ENGL200 2022 20 11 55   spring ENGL291 2022 8 5 63   spring ENGL440 2022 2 1 50   spring ENGE515 2023 13 1 8   spring ENGL200 2023 20 6 30   spring ENGL200 2023 16 7 44   spring ENGL200 2023 4 1 25   spring ENGL335 2023 14 4 29   summer ENGL200 2021 21 5 24   summer ENGE510 2022 16 4 25    Visual representations of this data are easily created:   Given this data, it seems prudent that one take the ovrerall scores with a grain of salt. Moreover, the low response rates on the evaluations is one of the major reasons why I have decided to spend so much time here in this narrative on the work my students are actually doing in my courses rather than too mechanically having recourse to the student evaluations data.The raw evaluation data can be found in the following .csv file—and the code written to generate these plot can be accessed here. 4.2 Full Teaching History Table     Semester Year Course Number and Title     Fall 2018 ENGL200Z2: Intro to Lit: Tolkien (online version)   Fall 2018 ENGL200B: Intro to Lit: Tolkien (f2f version)   Fall 2018 ENGL372: Shakespeare   Spring 2019 ACAF120K: Foundations II: #MeToo in the Age of Trump: Sex and Gender in Contemporary America</p>
