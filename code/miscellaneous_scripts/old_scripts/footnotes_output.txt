[^7]: This pedagogical principle that I have called "the with" became even more vivid, legible, and powerful, once I met my most favorite student I've ever had as a teacher, MaKenzie Hope Munson, in the Fall of 2020. The vast majority of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection is concerned with her and the educational trajectory that she and I built together singularly and uniquely for her. I greatly encourage readers to hop on over to that <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html" target="_blank">document</a> for a much more extensive treatment of this pedagogy than I will provide here in this narrative.

I should perhaps also mention that I can pull some explicit numbers here. Given that I've taught this course for multiple semesters, over multiple years, how often do students talk about more than the required number of authors in their posts? A little bit of coding and I can say that this kind of thing is certainly not the most common of phenomena—out of 2,353 posts, 23.5% percent of them talked about more than the required three stories in their main posts; in posts where students were responding to other students, more than three authors mentioned only occurred in 4.74% of those replies. (The Python code used to generate those numbers is available <a href="code/weird_fiction/counting_extra_text_mentions_in_wf.py">here</a>.)

[^14]: Again, the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft" target="_blank">entry</a> on this foundational pioneer of the entire genre is not too shabby.
[^15]: Code for this plot is, again, available <a href="code/weird_fiction/charting_weird_fiction_final_project_types.ipynb">here</a>.
[^16]: I speak about this quite a bit in the sections devoted to MaKenzie in my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#working-with-my-greatest-and-most-favorite-student-in-my-entire-career-as-a-teacherscholar-makenzie-hope-munson-23" target="_blank">Post-Tenure Review Reflection</a>.
[^17]: Of course, one might say that this word is also preferable over something like "alignment" because the noun form also might encapsulate the best sense of what "alignment" ought to mean. As the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/11189?rskey=YUgQZO&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank"><em>OED</em></a> notes—in definition 2. of this word: "Of hearing, thought, intelligence, etc.: distinct, clear; indicating clear understanding"—to articulate something is perhaps to get "aligned" in some way that is consistent with this definition. So, by this argument, "articulation" would give us the best of what "alignment" has to offer and, I would suggest, much, much, much more.
[^18]: In terms of a more general philosophical treatment of thinking itself as a kind of movement (done with MaKenzie), please see the remarks in Section 1.1.5 of my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#engl497-senior-thesis" target="_blank">"Post-Tenure Review Reflection</a>.
[^19]: I have not yet mentioned here in this reflection all of the wonrdeful work I have done with William D. Mastin, but all of <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#mathematics-literature-and-philosophy-with-william-d.-mastin-23" target="_blank">Section 1.2</a> of my "Post-Tenure Review Reflection is devoted to him and his educational growth and trajectory with me; most of <a href="#2-scholarship">Section 2</a> <em>infra</em> is dedicated to him as well.
[^20]: MaKenzie confirms this focus on autonomy in her <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_makenzie/mhm_reflection.pdf" target="_blank">"Reflection" on her Senior Capstone</a>, where she talks about one of the independent studies we worked on together in Fall of 2022: "Lastly, the Gender & Sexuality course is one that holds a special place in my heart: this is one I designed almost entirely by myself. That isn’t to say that Spicer enforced a great deal of rigidity in my other courses – some might even say that his name and any term relating to a lack of autonomy should hardly be placed in such close proximity – but this course is where I pitched the entirety of the reading list and schedule" (p. 5). I hope it's clear what's significant here: " ... some might even say that his name and any term relating to a lack of autonomy should hardly be placed in such close proximity." I couldn't agree with that more even if I tried.
[^21]: In my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html" target="_blank">Spring 2023 Post-Tenure Review Reflection</a> and also in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qKKrUolSupObXSvE20Y_T3ginshGEpUE/view" target="_blank"></a>document I composed chronicling all of the wonderful work I did with MaKenzie ("Reflections on MaKenzie Munson and Dr. Spicer's Co-Authored Essay on Lydia Millet's <em>A Children's Bible</em>—Supporting Materials for MaKenzie's Senior Thesis Capstone Requirement for the English Degree"), I spoke a great deal about the learning that happens <em>in the space between</em> teacher and student—as I theorized it there, what I constantly referred to as "the space of the between" is the space in which this thing called "articulation" happens and works itself out in the pedagogical context.
[^22]: Awareness of this concern strikes me as fully on display right at the start of Section 1.3 of my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#concluding-remarks-on-teaching-as-a-whole" target="_blank">"Post-Tenure Review Reflection"</a>.

[^24]: Again, I do not want to unnecessarily belabor the point, but my position here is still identical with the one given in my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#early-days" target="_blank">"Post-Tenure Review Reflection"</a> (Section 1.2.1) when I spoke of my teaching of William: "This wanting to treat each and every student according to their own singular uniqueness was not lost on William—no two students are the same and our relations to them, therefore, cannot be identical either."

[^30]: Full confession here, but I find that I also pull out this remark of Sarah's largely because I have (no doubt a perhaps some idiosyncratic thing about my personality) a seemingly constitutional inability to accept praise. And this is no doubt a problem given that my two most favorite students (Sarah can easily be included in this list of my "favorites," too, as can many, many more students I could mention) have written so much and sent way too much praise my way already (William does <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t69EB7v97sleK_XZ7DuBn5uh1ahSL_bL/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">here</a> in his cover letter for graduate school and MaKenzie does so <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rDG0Du3ZogXBX97gbalfe7tdN1yh1DQz/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">here</a> in her Senior Capstone Reflection, both of which I have spoken about unendingly in my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html" target="_blank">Post-Tenure Review Reflection</a>). I wrote <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_98">there</a> about how MaKenzie spent a good deal of our time together "tirelessly working to get me to accept" how impactful and life-changing our study was together. William has been attempting ever since we met to do something identical, as I <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_236" target="_blank">mention</a> also. I find, however, that what I wrote in <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_142" target="_blank">sidenote 93</a> of that document still accompanies me even now.

[^33]: Copious and infinite thanks go to Missie Rolinitis over in REAL, who was a constant ally and supporter not only of me in all my course creation work here, but also for all my fellow faculty members. REAL already possessed a quite explicitly well-thought and structured course design workflow—we English folks needed to get into that structure and flow. I could never have asked for a better partner and there is little doubt that much of the success of these courses is due to Missie and her unflinching help and expertise in getting all of us English teachers feeling quite comfortable within the REAL structure and their perspective on curricular design. Missie and REAL more broadly gave us full academic autonomy (a thing not to be given short-shrift, for no doubt obvious reasons) and, again, as I say, I could not have asked for anything more.

[^37]: I am hesitant to say how this might compare to others; I haven't the slightest idea if this is much more (or much less) than my faculty peers. (I ponder a similar question to this in Section 2.2 of my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#learning-how-to-code">Post-Tenure Review Reflection</a>, concerning the length of my ENGL200 students' discussion board posts each week, which, as noted already, do not have any word count limits set on them—I claimed there that students have a tendency to write quite long, nuanced, and extensive posts each and every week despite the fact that I put no limits or constraints on these in terms of post length.)

[^45]: Suzanne del Gizzo, personal communication, June 16, 2023.
[^46]: I speak quite strongly of my distaste for Hemingway in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_182">here</a>. And I also notice in that very same section that I <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_179" target="_blank">write something there</a> that bears repeating: "I think we want our students to be able to change us—and to really change us such that they can honestly, sincerely, and genuinely [<em>sic</em>] say of us, as MaKenzie did, that <em>she taught her teacher, she taught her mentor</em> something that he didn't know before. I would guess that William might be somewhat hesitant to agree that he managed to do this for me, but his reserved nature and quiet caution are completely and totally unwarranted here. MaKenzie drastically changed me; William did too. If our students can't do this to us, one wonders what it is we're all up to here in this whole pedagogical enterprise in the first place, at the end of the day."
[^47]: This story can be found in <em>The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigía Edition</em> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1987), pp. 211-214.
[^48]: The original draft submitted for publication can be read in full <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_william/hemingway_project/final_submitted_article/mastin_and_spicer_jig_on_the_border.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^49]: I would love to know how often my faculty peers write and publish work with undergraduates. I can speak with quite a bit of confidence when I say that, as far as the English Department is concerned, we have never had anyone do anything at all similar to the coauthored essay MaKenzie and I completed. I would love to figure out if this project is quite unprecedented within the larger context of, say, CAS, in general. My guess is that it's possible that other faculty in other disciplines have completed work like this—it would be nice to do a little asking around to say how really "unprecedented" it is, if at all.
[^50]: Feel free to see, among far too many other spots to count, <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_138" target="_blank">Section 1.2.1</a> of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection for more on this.
[^51]: Towards the latter half of our essay we spend a number of pages working through the consequences and implications of all the temporal oddities within this story: the focus on time and temporality in the story is all due to William—I didn't really notice them at all on the first read through—the fact that so much of our essay focuses on the time of the story comes from him.
[^52]: See his essay, "Of Structure as an Inmixing of an Otherness Prerequisite to Any Subject Whatever", in <em>The Structuralist Controversy: The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man</em>, ed. Richard Macksey and Eugenio Donato (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1970), 186-200; p. 190. Dates here might be worth noting: this citation comes from an address in 1966 at an incredibly infamous conference held at Johns Hopkins University; a few years earlier in Lacan's <em>Seminar VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis</em>, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller, trans. Dennis Porter (New York: W. W. Norton, 1992), he seems to have been quite content to get his students to count to four: "I have already asked the question here as to what the critical conceivable minimum is for a signifying scale, if the register of the signifier is to begin to organize itself. There cannot be a two without a three, and that, I think, must certainly include a four, the quadripartite, the <em>Geviert</em>, to which Heidegger refers somewhere" (pp. 65-66).
[^53]: This Lacanian concern with thirds, with cuts, with borders, with boundaries, runs all throughout the submitted draft for publication, but we (well, I should say "William" here) were onto this element very, very early on—it shows up explicitly in multiple spots in my own "initial_foray" draft of the paper, which can be read <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_william/hemingway_project/drafts/dr_s_initial_foray.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (page 11 is quite key on this front).
[^54]: Undoubtedly this focus on thirds comes from my background in psychoanalysis—but it was also all of the work of teaching Lacan to MaKenzie that was a factor here too. See (once more) my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qKKrUolSupObXSvE20Y_T3ginshGEpUE/view" target="_blank">"Reflection"</a> on her/our Capstone project, footnote 22, in particular, on page 13.
[^55]: See <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_143" target="_blank">Section 1.2.1</a> yet again for what I still find to be the key intellectual differences between these two.
[^56]: MaKenzie herself <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_makenzie/mhm_reflection.pdf" target="_blank">writes</a> quite a lot about this "talking before writing" in her "Reflection on My Time as an Undergraduate at the University of St. Francis"—pages 6-8 are very germane. I also write endlessly about this in <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#engl497-senior-thesis" target="_blank">Section 1.1.5</a> of my Post-Tenure Review Reflection, as I've probably mentioned way too many times already.
[^57]: Very key here are three incredibly well-known essays that both William and I read and respond to very carefully: Stanley Renner's "Moving to the Girl's Side of 'Hills Like White Elephants'," <em>The Hemingway Review</em> 15, no. 1 (1995): 27–41; David Wyche's very good "Letting the Air into a Relationship: Metaphorical Abortion in 'Hills Like White Elephants'," <em>The Hemingway Review</em> 22, no. 1 (2002): 56–71; Hilary K. Justice's really wonderful "Well, Well, Well: Cross-Gendered Autobiography and the Manuscript of 'Hills Like White Elephants'," <em>The Hemingway Review</em> 8, no. 1 (1998): 17–32; and, last but not least, Alex Link's very incisive stylistic treatment of the story in his "Staking Every Thing on It: A Stylistic Analysis of Linguistic Patterns in 'Hills Like White Elephants'," <em>The Hemingway Review</em>, vol. 23, no. 2, 2004, pp. 66–74. Far more other secondary essays find their way into our article's "Works Cited," to be sure, but these are the big ones.
[^58]: I think it was the one by Claude Maisonnat, "Falling into the Embrace of the Muse: Pregnancy as Problematic Creation in 'Hills Like White Elephants'," <em>Journal of the Short Story in English</em>, no. 49 (2007): 57–66. This essay is available in full <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/jsse/733" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^59]: I cannot help but note that this is another frighteningly similar characteristic shared between my two star students: MaKenzie did something absolutely identical with Deleuze's "Crime Novels" essay (which served as a huge foundational pillar of her reading of Millet's novel), a short text by Jerome Jeffrey Cohen that she used brilliantly to work up her sections of our essay, and, lastly, a couple of texts by Timothy Morton that found their way directly into the final published version. Feel free to see page 7 of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qKKrUolSupObXSvE20Y_T3ginshGEpUE/view" target="_blank">"Reflection"</a> on her Capstone project for more on this.
[^60]: Hemingway, "Hills," p. 211.
[^61]: Once again, I note the cross-pollination here that was working in the (unconscious?) background of my thinking. On the days when MaKenzie and I weren't working together in the Fall of 2022, I would often talk to William about what she and I had been reading and talking about. MaKenzie got really hooked on certain Lacanian perspectives of what I <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#teaching#para_48" target="_blank">wrote</a> about in my Post-Tenure Review Reflection concerning certain "differences between 'masculine' and 'feminine' ways of relating to signifiers, to language" not only in Lacan but in numerous other French feminist thinkers. Although this discussion interested MaKenzie quite a lot more than William, the latter instantly saw the usefulness of these theorizations that we were working towards slowly.
[^62]: For those that are curious, these notes can be read <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_william/hemingway_project/notes_and_jottings/notes_and_jottings.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

[^64]: Taken from my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qKKrUolSupObXSvE20Y_T3ginshGEpUE/view" target="_blank">"Reflection"</a> on the Millet project, p. 9; there are paragraphs on p. 10 as well that may also be very <em>a propos</em> on this question about style in writing.
[^65]: A screenshot of those timestamps can be viewed <a href="img/scholarship_related/hemingway_paper_timestamps.png" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^66]: This is undoubtedly a somewhat silly metric to use, but one could just look quickly at the Works Cited pages for both these projects. The Millet essay with MaKenzie ended-up with only twelve sources needed for us to make our argument; the Hemingway essay saw us making use of close to sixty sources in total.
[^67]: It would be odd to say that I contributed anything here when MaKenzie and William had to carry me most of the time—but I think there is a way to say that I was arguably trying to follow the mantra that I have <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_226">already</a> discoursed quite extensively about <em>re</em> what good mentorship looks like: "... I am not sure it's rocket science: just find the student's path of desire, how that desire works and wants to function, and then speak to that. Simple enough." I was just following the track and trace of William's desire here, nothing more.
[^68]: See <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#para_139" target="_blank">here</a> for just a tiny bit more on this "quiet" way William has of working and thinking.
[^69]: William spent a day or two wrangling with his chapter on metaphor in <em>Guerilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things</em> (Chicago: Open Court, 2005), pp. 101-124. Harman's take is definitely detectable in the atmosphere here in William's first draft.
[^70]: I speak a little bit about this <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/post_tenure_review_spring_2023/ptrr.html#teaching#para_162" target="_blank">here</a> as well.

[^75]: I think William himself shortchanges his own capacity to pull off this little rhetorical trick. In his solo writing, he has this really strong penchant for what one could call "the short paragraph," these very small and tight little blocks of texts—sometimes only a couple of sentences long—that he has already figured out how to marshal and use quite skillfully. As I told him, I just can't stand the short paragraph, even though it was always clear to me, reading his work, how he was trying to use this technique and what rhetorical effects he always wants them to have. I notice, looking back at the full draft, that William largely foregoes this preference of his—and, to my own admittedly very selfish narcissism here, find that his sections of writing include these wonderfully long and meandering paragraphs that will never, ever, not bring a smile to my face, no matter how many times I read them—long into the future.

[^79]: Once we had our huge tussle, the melding work went very quickly. I didn't do too much and most of my suggestions were ones that I would call "mortar-work," just slight little "metalanguage" tags that would help keep William's transitions throughout all his "scaffolding" sections clear, concise, and firmly delineated. A good example would be the opening sentence of the first full paragraph on page 6 of the <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_william/hemingway_project/final_submitted_article/mastin_and_spicer_jig_on_the_border.pdf" target="_blank">submitted draft</a>, which reads: "Before leaping immediately into the secondary criticism that has mentioned the curtian, we would like to offer a brief and small philosophical study of rooms and doors. Consider two rooms ..." The first clause of the first sentence is mine—all the rest of that paragraph is pure William.
[^80]: Yet another nice illustration of some of this mortar work is in the first full paragraph on page 8, which has the following: "The curtain is, itself, split and divided. It undermines itself; its very nature differs it from itself. At once, the beaded curtain partitions space in exactly the manner we have described and allows this separation to be continually and continuously breached. The beaded curtain is Hemingway’s answer to the riddle 'what is a barrier that one can pass through?'' This is the curtain's function: to simultaneously join, separate, and fail to do either definitively. This functionality would seem to be shared amongst the train station, the beaded curtain, and the pregnant Jig: all three function as indeterminate loci for numerous opposites." William's original had a mention of the March-Hare's infamous riddle—"How is a raven like a writing desk?"—from <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and although it felt criminal to chop it, the final version still keeps some of the original playfulness of William's prose.

[^83]: Just a couple examples of this softening will have to suffice. On <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_william/hemingway_project/final_submitted_article/mastin_and_spicer_jig_on_the_border.pdf" target="_blank">page 9</a>, before we put forward a different interpretation from Justice's reading of the infamous curtain in the story, we write: "What would it mean for one to fixate on the curtain more formally? Justice's reading really seems to be on the right track: the significance here is not so much that Jig reaches out to hold 'two strands' nor to clearly signal that some kind of 'decision' has been made on her part (indeed, we would like to argue that this gesture precisely does not signal a decision at all), but that she is the one to 'play with,' one might say, the thing that creates the division." Also, in a good deal of the second half of paper, and on page 26 in particular, where we take on multiple prior readings and put them through the ringer: "It strikes us that Renner is more than right to highlight this point in the narrative, though we would like to question whether or not there is, as he claims, 'a pivotal turn, in terms of both structure and character development' here ..." This is what I tried to describe as being "charitable" to these wonderful readings; William's original takes were, as I say, a little "too hot to the touch" for my taste.
[^84]: I think the inclusion of this "charitableness" towards the brilliant Hemingway scholars whose wake we have followed in can be seen in the <a href="supporting_materials/2_scholarship/work_with_william/hemingway_project/final_submitted_article/mastin_and_spicer_jig_on_the_border.pdf" target="_blank"></a>body of the paper; there are, also, a number of footnotes I added (William will say that "all of the footnotes" were due to me alone, which I think is probably accurate)—especially numbers 2, 3, 5, 14, and 16—that I hope fully demonstrate our attempts to be kind, charitable, and grateful to and for these prior readings.
[^85]: Yet again, there is a slightly difference here between the two of them: MaKenzie's profound intensity is similar in degree to William's—but the former manages to be just slightly more "diplomatic"—with quite a lot of decorum for a scholar and thinker who is still so young—and, I think, I am perhaps more dissimilar to William on this front than I am to MaKenzie. Still, the goal was pretty much the same—it was just that there was just a tad bit more work to be done with William's ferocity than MaKenzie's.

[^92]: One might say too here that the beauty of "blind peer review" is fully at work: it didn't matter at all that I wrote these essays with my students—nobody knew about their youth, only me. If the work and thinking and writing was good—then it was good; nobody is (nobody even could be) at all concerned with the authors and their particular qualities, statuses, and ranks: the work needs to speak for itself and it seems very clear that in both cases MaKenzie's and William's work did indeed "speak for itself." I cannot even begin to say how proud writing such sentences make me of them and all they've done with me.
[^93]: William has said to me in conversation that he is going to look forward greatly to the day when we write something together and my name shows up as the first author, before his name. I have told him that he will be waiting a very long time for such a day to come—it'll never come, for me, if I'm being completely honest—his name, MaKenzie's name, they will always come before mine.

[^102]: My initial and cursory exploration of the secondary literature would seem to be moving towards confirming this. In a nice edited collection by Jackson R. Bryer—<em>New Essays on F.

All decisions come with advantages and disadvantages, pros and cons. This decision was full of nothing but pros, nothing but advantages. I will never, ever, never second-guess it." I still find this sentiment to be absolutely true and would once more like to thank Dr. Ioanes for serving as Chair between 2022 and 2023.
